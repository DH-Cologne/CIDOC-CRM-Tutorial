					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM)</strong>
						provides definitions and a formal structure for describing the
						implicit and explicit concepts and relationships used in cultural
						heritage documentation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <strong>CIDOC CRM </strong>is intended to promote a shared
						understanding of cultural heritage information by providing a common
						and extensible semantic framework that any cultural heritage
						information can be mapped to. It is intended to be a common language
						for domain experts and implementers to formulate requirements for
						information systems and to serve as a guide for good practice of
						conceptual modelling. In this way, it can provide the "semantic
						glue" needed to mediate between different sources of cultural
						heritage information, such as that published by museums, libraries
						and archives.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <strong>CIDOC CRM </strong>is the culmination of over 10 years
						work by the

					<p>
						Welcome to the CIDOC CRM tutorial. We are going to go through how
						the standard was built up, the principles behind it and the contents
						of it and hopefully at the end of this you'll be able to use the CRM
						in your own research to take you forward, and combine the different
						data streams that you have available to you and bring them out as an
						integrated whole.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, the idea behind the CRM is that it is a standard which will help
						you integrate cultural information from a variety of sources and
						bring them together into an integrated environment where you can ask
						bigger questions than you can ask from the individual pieces that
						you have.
					</p>
					<p>
						My name is Stephen Stead, and I’m a member of the CIDOC Conceptual
						Reference Model Special Interest Group. CIDOC is the Comite
						Internationale pour la Documentation &lt;the International Committee
						for Museum Documentation&gt;, part of ICOM (the International
						Council of Museums). They have hosted the development work over the
						last 15 years of the CIDOC CRM, and acted as a place where we can
						gather people from multidisciplinary teams to give us a range of
						inputs into CRM. So the CRM is not just a Museum standard, it’s a
						standard that reaches across museums, libraries and archives and
						it's fully multidisciplinary in the way it’s been put together.
						We've had everything from physicists through to archaeologists,
						which is a fairly wide mix of different people. Disciplines from all
						over the world have contributed to this, so that it's not North
						American or European-centric, it's a truly international
						multidisciplinary approach to developing a standard. Over the next
						few hours I'll take you through the way the standard was conceived,
						the methodology we’ve used and the contents of it, so that hopefully
						you'll be able to see how to use it. I’ll give you a few examples of
						applications of it, for projects that we've seen and used already.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-2"><h2>Slide 2</h2>
					<p>
						To get us started, I'll set the scene by giving us a problem
						statement, which will talk about the diversity of information that
						we have in the cultural heritage domain and how we’re going to bring
						that together as part of the desire to tell bigger stories. The CRM
						is designed to enable us to do that - we’ll look at an example of
						how we might use it to give us some motivation, a way of looking at
						the different data streams and how we’re going to combine them to
						produce a richer environment for us to ask questions in. Then we’ll
						talk about what the CRM was intended for, what things it doesn’t do,
						and talk about the methodology behind how we’ve made it and the form
						that it takes - what decisions there are, what design processes
						there are in there, and what they resulted in. And then we’ll look
						at the contents of the standard, so we’ll actually go through very
						different pieces of the standard, how they are work together to give
						us this integrating environment. Then we’ll talk about using it –
						we’ll give you some examples of its application in different fields.
						Finally, I’ll finally talk about the state of development: where
						we’ve got to, what the future holds for us and then a few
						conclusions to round the session off.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-3"><h2>Slide 3</h2>
					<p>
						So here’s the problem – we have cultural information from a very
						large domain and we have different types of information from
						different subdomains, different communities within the overarching
						cultural heritage domain, and they have very different sets of data
						that they want to integrate together. We have things like collection
						descriptions from a variety of institutions; we have collection
						descriptions of fine art; of archaeological-cultural heritage;
						physical cultural heritage information; we have information about
						natural history and geology; industrial processes - a wide range of
						information about a wide range of objects that we hold in our
						collections, the things that we’re interested in. In addition we
						have information in archives and literature, where we have the
						records about things that have been done, so we have copies of
						treaties, of contracts; we have letters written between people; we
						have artful works - things like poems and novels and plays - which
						have been produced as part of our cultural heritage, and we have
						records about the them as well. Now that’s given us things about the
						stuff that we have in our collections. We also need to administer
						those collections and preserve the objects and conserve them, so we
						have a wide range of documentation about the process of looking
						after those things and making them available to the public, about
						how we manage their preservation, and the actual processes of their
						conservation and preservation. We’ll have records about what
						treatments have been made on particular papers, what treatments are
						being made on objects, and how those have changed over time. So that
						gives us a record of the things that we have and how we’ve looked
						after them. And then we start to interpret them, to add to our
						knowledge about them, and this can be generally thought of as
						investigation and interpretation - the science and scholarship area.
						And we produce lots of new knowledge from the data that we hold
						about the things. So we’ve got data about them and how we’ve managed
						them, and then we start looking at them and developing knowledge,
						telling stories about the past and about human behaviour in the
						past, which we then wish to communicate. The final piece in the
						jigsaw is the presentation of this material, and that presentation
						might be to a group of our peers who have similar interests, and we
						are trying to convey the detailed knowledge that we've produced in
						our scholarly research, or it might be to a wider public, where
						we're trying to educate in some way. And that education might be to
						children or to adults as part of their continuing investigation of
						the world around them - hopefully that's something that carries on
						throughout their lives. And we’ll do that either as publications,
						which might be a scholarly treatise for our peers, or it might be a
						coffee table book with lots of colour pictures for a more general
						public. We’ll have teaching materials that we’ll produce for
						different communities, from adult education through to kindergarten,
						and we’ll have exhibitions which we’ll put on in the museums and
						institutions that we produce catalogues for and guides to and so on.
						So we have a wide range of presentation materials which we also want
						to integrate into our environment.
					</p>
					<p>
						So we’ve got all of these different strands of information, enriched
						by the fact that there are many different subdisciplines,
						subdomains, working in different parts of the cultural heritage
						sector. They’ll have their own particular areas of interest, their
						own particular research methodologies, their own particular types of
						research question they want to ask. That adds another rich web to
						this rich set of datatypes.
					</p>
					<p>
						So how do we make a documentation standard that allows us to bring
						all of this together? Well, it’s kind of difficult, because each of
						these different aspects has different methods, different forms,
						different communication requirements to disseminate and gather in
						information, in order to make the story rich. And while we find that
						there's lots of overlap in the data we’re interested in, we find it
						very difficult to build one schema which will hold all of it. We’ve
						tried - in the early 90s a very large project produced an entity
						relationship diagram, a relational model for museum data, and it was
						huge: it covered an entire wall with the table structure, and by the
						time you'd worked from the left-hand side to the right-hand side,
						you'd forgotten what there was on the left-hand side. Many
						discussions during the development were repeating discussions that
						had taken place a couple of years before, as we developed something
						further to the left. So it was a very complex environment and we
						found that this entity relationship diagram and this relational
						model were so big that very few people could understand it, and when
						we try to deploy it, we found that effectively nobody could use it.
						It <em>wasn’t</em> rich enough to actually hold all the information
						that we wanted to hold, but it was too complex for anybody to
						actually understand. So in a way it failed, but in another way
						succeeded, in that it showed us that we had to develop in a new way
						- and that new way was what we've used to produce the CRM. So we
						went for an object-oriented approach rather than a relational
						approach, and we started to look at a new way of bringing together
						information and understanding how it related to each other, how
						different pieces related to each other. We found out from work that
						was done at the Benaki Museum in Athens that a really powerful way
						to understand things that have happened in the past is to understand
						the relationships between those things and where they’ve met in time
						and space, so we can think of all of the things that have happened
						to our objects - our administration of them, our scholarly research,
						the things that happened to them in the past - as being &lt;part
						of&gt; events which have had different things there, and which have
						therefore expressed part of a story. So we can understand lives from
						the relationships between things and where they've met. And this
						began to give us a totally new insight into how to develop a
						standard which would give us access to this rich web of information
						that we had, but which we were finding very difficult to organise in
						any traditional way.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-4"><h2>Slide 4</h2>
					<p>
						Let's have a look at an example that will take us through the
						problem in more detail, and look and show what CRM does to help
						solve that problem. Here’s a very well-known document – it’s the
						protocol of the proceedings of the Crimea conference. This was a
						conference held between the Allied powers in 1945 to decide how they
						were going to divide up Europe and Japan after the Second World War.
						They could see that they were going to win, and they wanted to make
						a decision about which spheres of influence different parts of the
						Axis powers would be placed in. The meeting was between the Premier
						of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Prime Minister of
						the United Kingdom and the President of the United States of
						America, and they drew up this document, which declares the way the
						world will be after the end of hostilities. And if we look here we
						have a Dublin Core record for this famous document. It’s a text,
						it’s called the Protocol of the Proceedings of the Crimea
						Conference, subtitled the Declaration of Liberated Europe, and it’s
						dated 11th February 1945. It was created by these three great men,
						or the posts they were in. It was published by the State Department
						in the US and its subject is the post-war division of Europe and
						Japan. And that points to this document - it’s the Dublin Core
						record for this document.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-5"><h2>Slide 5</h2>
					<p>
						Now there is a famous photograph of the three great men at this
						conference, and much has been read into their body posture and the
						way they do or don't look at each other, and where they're staring
						at. We’ve got Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill here, and this
						photograph you can actually get from Microsoft Encarta. The Dublin
						Core record for it is: it’s an image, it’s the Allied leaders at
						Yalta, it’s dated 1945, published by United Press International, and
						they never attributed anything to their individual photographers, it
						was always a UPI photograph, so there’s no individual photographer.
						It’s in the Bettmann Archive. The copyright for the Bettmann archive
						is given to [??] Corbis, and Corbis have licensed it to Microsoft
						for the Encarta, and here it references Churchill, Roosevelt and
						Stalin, different references to the same people - now we talking
						about their surnames rather than the posts that they held at the
						time they generated the document. Now, how do we get this photograph
						of the meeting and the document that they produced at that meeting
						together - how do we join them together? Well, if we look at the
						Dublin Core records, there’s not very much which allows us to get to
						the fact that this image is about the event where the document was
						created. If we look backwards and forwards between these two slides,
						the only thing that they have in common is the year 1945 – that’s
						quite a big search term. If you put 1945 into any search engine,
						you’re going to get a huge number of hits; it’s going to take a very
						long time to sort through them, and the chances of you actually
						noticing that this photograph and this document are related is very
						slim. It’s a big task, it’s going to take you all your life, and
						there are more important things in life than looking for a
						photograph of the event where somebody wrote a document that you're
						interested in. So probably not very much is going to happen there -
						but what happens if we add another data stream to these two streams,
						and try and get them to link together?
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-6"><h2>Slide 6</h2>
					<p>
						Well, let's take another data stream. Here we've got the TGN - the
						Thesaurus of Geographical Names, produced by the Getty - and it goes
						through and talks about places. It gives us an identifier for them
						and then it says that there are different names for this place, with
						different spellings; it says that it's an inhabited place or a city;
						it gives us a latitude and longitude; and then it places it in a
						hierarchy - so it's in Europe, it’s in the Ukraine and it's in the
						Krim- the Crimea. And it’s the site of the conference between Allied
						powers in World War II in 1945. So yet another different way of
						expressing this meeting – it’s in the TGN, the Thesaurus of
						Geographic Names. And here’s a picture of Yalta. Now, if we go and
						look at
						<em>another</em> record in here - the record for Krim, we’ll find
						the alternative spelling of Crimea, so now we have a way of joining
						together the place – Yalta - with Crimea, where this conference took
						place in Europe. So this gives us a way of joining things together
						by using yet another data stream. So instead of more datastreams
						making life even more complicated, more data streams allow us to
						produce a link that allows us to get from one object to another
						object through intermediary steps, intermediary data sources. And
						that helps us produce an interesting picture of the world, a picture
						of the world which allows us to ask bigger questions.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-7"><h2>Slide 7</h2>
					<p>
						But there are a couple of problems that we need to deal with. The
						first is the identity problem – it’s part of our integration. We
						have different actors, and they have different names and different
						roles, all of which come together to produce a problem as to which
						person is which. How do we know that a document that’s talking about
						Joseph Stalin is also the same thing as an allied leader - how do we
						know that Stalin is the Premier of the Union of Soviet Socialist
						Republics? We need some way of bringing together these different
						identities and producing a single point, which tells us where that
						person is or who that person is. We’ve got a similar thing with
						different spellings of place names – Jalta and Yalta, Krim and
						Crimea - and we need to bring together different events: how do we
						know that the Crimea Conference is a different way of saying that
						the Allied leaders were at Yalta, which is a conference between
						Allied powers about the post-war division? These are all events
						which we need to identify as being one thing, so that we can relate
						different things to them. And of course we have different types of
						objects and documents that we need to be able to point to
						consistently across our environment, our web of information. We’ve
						got the photograph and the agreement text – so that’s one level of
						problem that we have to deal with.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-8"><h2>Slide 8</h2>
					<p>
						Another level of problem is that we have things which are hidden,
						which are not in the original records, which are hidden behind
						things. We don't know that Yalta and Crimea are places, that there
						is a relationship between Yalta and Crimea from the original
						documentation. We have to rely on the third set of documentation to
						give us the information that Yalta is <em>in</em> the Crimea. How do
						we know who the Allied leader is, or who the Allied power is? These
						are hidden people: we’ve got the title for them, but we don't know
						who it is that’s behind that title, and there are many variations of
						the way that title might be written, or that hidden name might be
						disguised. And again we have a similar problem with events. So how
						do we find the real thing and how do we identify it? The two of
						these &lt;are&gt; big problems. So what we need are the elements
						that are going to enable us to make those problems go away. How do
						we solve them? Well, we need the correct meta-data elements and
						&lt;we need to&gt; understand the relationships between those meta
						data elements in order to bring together the different data streams
						and get them to talk about the same thing. Or rather, they are
						talking about the same thing, but &lt;we need to make them&gt;
						enable us to identify the same thing in these different records and
						bring them together so that we can produce bigger stories.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-9"><h2>Slide 9</h2>
					<p>
						So let’s have a look at an example of how we might do that for the
						Yalta problem. Here we have some events which are going to help us
						bring together these different strands of information. We have an
						activity, which was the conference itself, and during that activity
						there was another activity, which was the creation of the document -
						the proceedings of the conference. So this creation event created
						the Yalta Agreement. The activity took place at some time within
						February 1945, and the creation was ongoing throughout 11<sup
							>th</sup
						>
						February, the date of the Yalta agreement in 1945. And the different
						actors and the different people – here I’ve just used a thumbnail of
						the person’s face to represent them – the three of them participated
						in the Crimea conference and performed the creation of the Yalta
						agreement. This Crimea conference is referred to by this image, so
						this image is documenting the conference, and the activity took
						place at place 701 2124, the TGM reference for Yalta. So that gives
						me access to all of the hierarchy of the Yalta records and Crimea
						records in the TGM. By using these events which we've created within
						our data structures, we are able to link together all of the
						different aspects of those two or three different data streams and
						produce a linkage which allows us to understand the relationships
						between the actors, the time and the place, and the things that have
						been produced: the documents and photographs. And by doing that we
						can now start to hook other information into here as well: maybe we
						know the names of other people who were at the conference and we can
						bring those in. This central activity allows us to link together a
						whole range of different information sources which are about things
						going there: so maybe we get the travel orders for somebody who went
						there or the Hotel receipts from an archive of people who stayed in
						the hotel at that time. We can bring together all of that
						information to tell a richer and richer story about the Yalta
						Conference.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-10"><h2>Slide 10</h2>
					<p>
						So what does the CIDOC-CRM do for us then? Well, it captures the
						underlying semantics, the underlying rules of the documentation
						structures that we use in the different parts of the discipline.
						What we did was &lt;that&gt; we went out and we gathered together
						all of the different documentation structures which were in use, and
						we analysed them to understand what it is that’s common across all
						of them. It was those common things that we then extracted and made
						into the objects that the CRM deals with. And we've taken them out
						and put them into a formal ontology. What's an ontology? It’s a much
						abused and misused word – ontologies are formalised knowledge,
						they’re the set of concepts and relationships which tell us about
						the possible states of affairs that exist in the domain we’re
						interested in. So it’s all of the different pieces that we talk
						about in our domains and the rules which allow them to be related to
						each other. What can a person do? What can an actor do? What's the
						difference between an actor and a person? All of those rules are
						things that we encapsulate in the ontology, so that we understand
						what these concepts are and how they relate to each other - what
						ways can we relate them to each other. That’s what the ontology does
						for us. The nice thing about them is that you and I can read them
						because they're human readable, but machines / computers can process
						them for us, so that we can get all of the boring stuff - sifting
						through data - done by a machine, and just look at the interesting
						results. This enables us to do data exchange between organisations,
						between different databases within an organisation. There are
						examples of the CRM being used in organisations where they have
						many, many data structures within the organisation, and they want to
						try and link them together. At the moment, they do that by re-keying
						the data into each of their data repositories, which is a very
						expensive and time-consuming task. Now what they can do is use the
						CRM to exchange that data automatically between their different
						research databases, and not have to re-key all of the data. So that
						gives us data exchange &lt;and&gt; data integration: we can bring
						together disparate data sources and combine them into a single
						stream of data, which will hopefully tell us more stories. We can
						also use it as a model for doing query mediation so that we can ask
						questions at the CRM level and they can be translated into queries
						that will attach to different databases and different data streams
						that we want to bring together. That's what the CRM does for us, and
						this gives us semantic interoperability, by giving us an extensible
						ontology of relationships: we have these classes, these object types
						that we have distilled from all of the different data structures
						that we use in cultural heritage, and we understand the
						relationships between them. However, we have produced something that
						sits at the top level. For a particular research question, there may
						be more detail beneath, so one of the things we've done with the CRM
						is make it extensible - we can add more detail where more detail
						exists within people's particular research databases. So where you
						have greater detail than the CRM allows for, you want to
						differentiate between very fine differences within your data - very
						fine differences within the relationships within your data - you can
						extend the CRM to give you that power, that additional inferential
						power about the very detailed stuff that you record in your research
						database. But by allowing it to be an extension of the CRM, by
						adding in the extra pieces that allow us to make extensions built
						into the standard, we can still query these extra pieces of
						information using the concepts which are available in the CRM. So
						when you extend, you have to follow certain rules. The rules are
						that everything you build must be a subclass of something that we
						already have, and any of the relationships that you have between
						things must be sub-properties of the properties we already have. Now
						that might sound a bit complicated at the moment, but as we go
						through you’ll see how these hierarchies work. You’ll be able to
						understand that this is a very powerful mechanism, which allows us
						to query using the generalised formats that we have for working the
						CRM, while still allowing you to go into the greatest detail that
						you need to for your particular research question. By doing that, it
						gives us this fantastically rich environment to play with, and we
						drive the whole thing by using events, so we are what's called an
						event-centric model: everything revolves around events that are in
						our data. Now many of our data structures don't explicitly talk
						about events – so for instance an archaeological database will have
						a record for a context, something that was excavated by an
						archaeologist. That archaeological context record will not have a
						field for “excavated by” and it won't have a field for “deposited
						by”, where “by” means the event that did it - the event is implicit
						in the data structure. We know that somebody dug it up because there
						is a record for it in the database, we don't have an explicit event
						which says: “this is being dug up,” and we don't have an explicit
						event saying: “this is being deposited by some social process in the
						past,” so those events are <em>hidden</em> in the data, they are
						implicit in our data structures. We get that a lot, for instance if
						you look at a Fine Art database, and we have a statue, there is no
						explicit representation of the event of the making of the statue.
						There might be a <em>date</em> associated with the statue, but the
						statue &lt;itself&gt; doesn't have a date, it’s when the statue was
						made that has the date. There might be an artist: well, the artist
						isn't in the statue, they’re not part of it, they weren't welded
						into the inside of it as part of making it. They were the person
						that performed the act of creating it, so we have the making of the
						statue at a particular date by a particular person, but we don't
						have a record for that event itself: it is implicit in the data
						structure that we know that the statue exists, so it was made, so
						there was a making event. We attach these other pieces of
						information to the statute rather than to the event, which was the
						making of the statue. We disguise that event. So what we do is we
						bring those events out of the underlying data structures and make
						them <em>explicit</em>, because that gives us the power to hook
						other data from other data streams into that event. It provides us
						with the hooks that allow us to do integration. By doing this, it
						gives us the ability to create shared explanations. Now those shared
						explanations are shared not only amongst people within the
						sub-domain where we started, but also with other sub-domains,
						because the CRM is multidisciplinary: it's across domain data
						structure. Consequently, when we explicitly extract information from
						a particular research database and put it into the CRM, we make it
						available for people who don't work in that particular subfield, but
						we give it to them so that they can use it as a shared explanations
						as well. This is far more powerful than prescribing a common data
						structure. We tried that and, as I said, it doesn't work, because
						the requirements of all the different sub-disciplines, of all the
						different research projects, of all the different research questions
						that all those different research project want to ask is
						<em>too much</em>, it overloads the database structure so much that
						it becomes unusable, too rich. But by producing this shared
						explanation, we can allow people to share their information across
						sub-disciplines, across their research questions, across their
						research projects. The other problem with producing a prescriptive
						data structure is that it tends to fossilise research. If it's taken
						us years to produce the data structure that we’re all going to share
						and use and be happy about - happy being gritted teeth happiness
						rather than a full smiley happiness - we can't add to that easily,
						because adding a new field to help answer a new research question is
						a huge process. It tends to fossilise things because it's so
						monolithically difficult to push forward, to have new ideas, to go
						and do something different that nobody does it. Or if they do, they
						don’t share, it just disappears: effectively, the knowledge that is
						gained from that research becomes hidden. We don't want that to
						happen - the only people who can make new research are the
						researchers who go out and have new ideas. By having those new ideas
						they think of new questions to ask, and they want to gather new data
						to help them answer those questions. Some of those will be dead
						ends, but we don't know whether they're dead ends until people have
						actually done the research, gathered the data and tried to use it to
						answer the questions. And of course, if it fails it doesn't matter:
						we've added to our knowledge that that is not something that we
						should bother with anymore. However if it succeeds, we've opened up
						a whole new area, a whole new arena for us to do research in.
						Consequently, we want to have dynamic question asking, dynamic
						processes for developing new data that we want to gather. We don't
						want a prescriptive recording methodology which stifles that kind of
						development, so by using this shared explanation approach, this
						object-oriented approach, where we can extend the data structures
						when we need to, to add new detail, we stop data being locked.
						Consequently, we enable research to grow, develop and morph, become
						exciting again. <em>That's </em>what we want to achieve, and the CRM
						is this ontology that allows us to do it. Now the nice thing about
						the ontology is that it's a language that can be shared by the IT
						community, by the software developers, and by the museums, libraries
						and archives community - the people, the experts in our domain.
						Consequently, we use the language as a way of allowing these two
						completely different groups with very different desires in the world
						to talk to each other, so it produces a language of interface
						between the software developers, the IT world and the cultural
						heritage domain professionals. Obviously for that to work we had to
						develop it using both communities, we couldn't just develop it as
						cultural heritage specialists, because we wouldn't have had the
						language that is required to talk to the IT people. We’ve seen many
						mistakes in the past, where the IT community have come along and
						told the cultural heritage community: “This is the way it's going to
						be!”
					</p>
					<p>
						My all-time favourite story of this was when I worked for an
						archaeological unit in Scotland some years ago, and the guy who’d
						been the previous software developer there had gone to one of the
						excavation teams on the first day of the excavation and said:
						“Right, how many contexts are you going to find?” And the
						archaeologist said: “I don't understand the question.” And the
						computer person said: “Well, I want to know how many contexts you’re
						going to find, so I can build the database ready for them to all be
						put in. And the archaeologist went: “You’re mad - I don't know how
						many contexts I’m going to find.” And the computer person went: “How
						can you not know? You're doing science, you’re supposed to know
						these things!” and it was just like these two people completely
						missed each other – &lt;there was a&gt; complete misunderstanding of
						what each side wanted to achieve.
					</p>
					<p>
						So what we've done is we've done the interdisciplinary work – we’ve
						had computer science people involved in the development so that
						we’re using the correct language, so we can explain it to them. But
						we've had the cultural heritage people – museums, library and
						archives community involved, so that they can talk in a language
						which makes sense to them. So it's a multidisciplinary,
						interdisciplinary approach and the hosting by CIDOC of the whole
						process has meant that it has actually succeeded: that we do have a
						standard where the computer IT community can understand what we're
						saying and the heritage community can understand what it is that's
						in there, so that it is a language that allows us to communicate
						between these two different communities.

					<p>
						So what did we end up with? Well, we’ve got the conceptual reference
						model hosted by the International Council of Museums through CIDOC.
						It’s 86 classes and 137 properties - so there’s 86 types of things
						that we've identified and 137 different ways that they relate to
						each other. Now that’s not very big. Some of the chemistry
						ontologies – for very small pieces of organic chemistry, or for drug
						interactions in the pharmacy world - are hundreds of thousands of
						classes, with hundreds of even millions of properties relating to
						each other. So this is very compact, and those other ontologies
						covered very small things, but we cover a huge array of information.
						We've got all of museums, libraries and archives across all of
						cultural heritage - so a massive domain covered by something that is
						very tight. And as you get used to using the CRM, you'll find that
						most of those 86 classes / 137 properties will stick in your mind,
						and you’ll be able to remember that there’s one there. You might not
						know precisely what its definition is at any one time, but you'll
						know that it's there and that you need to go and look it up. It's
						very human in scale, so you can actually remember it and use it
						easily. It takes a little bit of practice, but 10 days with and you
						will find that you have most of it in your head. It has the capacity
						to explain <em>hundreds</em> of metadata formats. Now when we say
						“explain hundreds”, we really have done it: there was one project in
						the research library group which mapped 1460 different data
						structures using the CRM together. So we have literally thousands of
						data structures that have been mapped to the CRM, which means that
						we can explain all of the contents of those different data
						structures using the CRM: we've made them interoperable, we've made
						them able to have a shared explanation of the world. It was accepted
						by at the International Standards Organisation, ISO Technical
						Committee 46 in September 2000, and it went through the fast track
						ISO process, which means that it actually became a standard in
						October 2006. That’s the fast track - six years – imagine what the
						slow track is like! We got it through the process and we have ISO
						21127, published in 2006. That’s the international standard, so it's
						not just something that’s thought to be a good idea by a community
						within. We’ve also got it accepted excepted at the International
						Standards Organisation level, so that many different countries
						looked at it and voted on it and got it and it’s been accepted. It’s
						now something that is a touchstone across the international scene,
						as well as within our discipline. What does it do for us? Well, it
						serves as an intellectual guide to creating schemata formats and
						profiles, so when you go out to design your database you can use the
						CRM as a way of checking that you not doing something silly. As an
						example of this, the Finnish National Gallery redeveloped their
						collections management system and they used the CRM to help them do
						that. They had five people working on the project, and they estimate
						that it saved them one year’s development, so that instead of it
						taking nearly 2 years to develop it, they completed the
						redevelopment of their management system in just over 10 months -
						five man years of work was saved by using the CRM. They found it was
						so useful to them that they were able not to worry about things -
						they could use the CRM to say: “Yes, that’s the way we do it!”,
						because hundreds of experts have spent years giving us that
						information. In effect, using the CRM to help you check the data
						structures that you're about to deploy into your new project saves
						you about 150 person years of thinking, because that is roughly
						what's gone into the development of the CRM. We've worked on it for
						more than 15 years, and there have been literally a hundred or more
						people involved, so 150 person-years - and it’s free to download!
						That’s pretty cheap really. Lots of research, very little time for
						you to absorb it. So that’s one way we can use it. It's also a
						language for us to analyse our existing sources so that we can do
						the integration tasks. We can bring things together and get a nice
						rich web of information out of our different data structures and
						different data sources, to bring everything together. It gives us
						the language for taking these different data structures and
						understanding what's actually in them,&lt;for&gt; making explicit
						the events – taking them apart, opening them up so that we can
						combine our different data sources, different data streams into one
						big richer environment. Finally, it also acts as a transportation
						format, by labelling things correctly with the CRM classes and the
						properties that link the objects together, we can produce an
						environment that allows us to move data about, where all of the
						meaning is in the data. I've got everything I need to explain
						encapsulated in it, so it gives me an environment where I can do
						integration -which we've talked about - but I can also migrate from
						one generation of software to the other, and I can provide for
						digital preservation of my data over long periods of time, because
						it's a very simple format to hold it in. We can hold it as text, but
						that text holds all the richness of the semantics of all of the
						rules we have embedded in our desk instructions, in our ways of
						working. Obviously, these types of things work very well in an
						Internet environment, so we can push that data out, and other people
						can use it, they can harvest our data and start to use it for their
						applications. They can enrich their knowledge and their environment
						to give them a much better approach to tackling their questions. It
						gives them more power.

				<div class="chapter" id="slide-12"><h2>Slide 12</h2>
					<p>
						We can think of the CRM as being a piece in the chain of our
						intellectual understanding of the analogue world that we live in. So
						here's the world - with tigers and telephones and desks and all that
						- in a nice analogue way, with electrons flying around and
						interacting with each other, and we abstract from that using some
						conceptualisation: the things that we're interested in. We go into
						this analogue world and we say: “Yes, we’ve got this thing here and
						it’s a tiger, and we’ve got this thing here and it's a snake, and
						we’ve got this thing here, which is a strange person who lives in
						the jungle with a telephone.” And we have a telephone. We then build
						data structures and metadata to tell us where things are in there,
						and put the data into databases which refer to that. What the CRM
						does is it sits and informs this conceptualisation, and motivates
						the data structures that we actually produce. So it acts as a link
						between us thinking: “Ooh, there’s a tiger!” and “Right, we need a
						database where we’re going to put the tiger. We need a data
						structure which will allow us to talk about tigers and the things
						that tigers do.” Obviously, waiting for the telephone in this case!
						So how do we actually set about that? Well, we use the CRM to
						provide us with a touchstone that says: “These are the kinds of
						things that we're interested in, and these are the ways they relate
						to each other, these are the properties that link these things
						together.” So it enables us to take the raw conceptualisation and
						put it into data structures and metadata structures which will then
						refer back to the real world, but in a way that we can follow, that
						we can reuse.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-13"><h2>Slide 13</h2>
					<p>
						How have we actually built the CRM? What has it actually done? Well,
						it’s a formal ontology, in that it’s a set of rules - the set of
						things that we’re going to talk about and the relationships between
						them - and we've defined it in a language called TELOS. Do you need
						to know TELOS in order to work with the CRM? Absolutely not, it's
						just a language that allows us to define these things in a sensible
						manner and automatically process them. Nobody really understands
						TELOS in the cultural heritage community – it’s a thing used by
						computer scientists. So we don't need to worry about the fact that
						the CRM is in TELOS or in anything else. But TELOS is a useful way
						of holding these ontologies. The actual data, the instances of the
						CRM, as it’s referred to, can be encoded in many ways. We can deploy
						this knowledge about how things relate to each other -this ontology
						- in lots of different ways. We can use a relational database –
						we’ve seen deployments of this using Oracle, for instance. We can
						use object-oriented databases - extensions to relational or pure 00
						databases. We can use XML, and we’ve seen many deployments of CRM
						into XML or, probably a little more richly, RDFS. If you don't know
						what those are, it doesn't matter - those are what you ask your
						computer science buddies to deal with, and they'll understand it.
						The CRM will explain to them what it is that they’re going to deploy
						into those different technologies. So it doesn't matter if you don't
						know what they are - you've got the language to explain what you
						want to achieve in those different technologies to the person who
						does understand them. We use a thing called Multiple isAs. A
						multiple isA is a way of expressing richness of structure in a very
						simple way. We do this so that we can achieve uniqueness of
						properties. Let's take an example of me: I am a person and -
						simultaneously - a person is somebody who can act, who can do stuff
						- and I'm a biological object. Some people think maybe not, but I am
						a biological object, and so I am simultaneously both a biological
						object and an actor. And that’s what a multiple isA does for us - it
						allows me to have the properties of being a biological object
						<em>and</em> the properties of being an actor together at the same
						time. I’ll show you a little bit more about that in a few slides’
						time. We also use the concept of multiple instantiation: for
						instance, when we give an object or sell an object to a museum,
						we're going to do multiple things. We’re going to change who looks
						after it: it’s going to go from me to the museum. I’m going to give
						the museum the custody of the object, but I'm also going to give
						them ownership of it, so we're changing ownership. That’s two
						<em>different </em>tasks that we are doing by depositing this object
						with the museum. Now sometimes I'll give a museum the object, but
						I’ll keep ownership of it – so I’m going to <em>lend</em> it to the
						museum. Well, that changes custody but it doesn’t change ownership.
						Or, <em>I</em> might continue to look after it, if it’s a big thing
						in a field somewhere, but the museum might take ownership of it. So
						&lt;for example&gt;, I’ve got a big steam engine in a field. I’m
						going to leave it in the field, I’m going to continue to look after
						it, but I’m going to give the ownership of it to the museum. So we
						separate those out into two different things - change of ownership /
						change of custody. Then we can combine them to produce different
						combinations of those depositing things with museums, which allow us
						to say exactly what’s happened without having to have lots of
						different types of giving something to a museum. It also allows us
						to deal with things like something being destroyed deliberately: I
						break something or smash it up, or it just gets broken. Entropy
						takes over and it becomes a pile of bits. In either of those cases,
						the thing is destroyed, but in one of them I’m doing it: it’s an
						activity, I’m actually there breaking it, &lt;but&gt; in another
						there isn’t an activity, there’s nobody involved with it, it just
						happens. So I don't want to have a destruction which is done by
						somebody, and another case where the destruction is
						<em>not</em> done by somebody. I just want to be able to combine the
						different aspects of things – “the destruction of it” and “there’s
						somebody doing it” - by using multiple instantiation to bring
						together those different types of thing into one. So I can have a
						destruction event and the activity of somebody doing it, and by
						combining them I can now say <em>who</em> did it. Multiple
						instantiation greatly simplifies the picture of the way the world
						works. We can use this in a number of ways: I can talk about those
						kinds of events where things get destroyed, and I can also talk
						about events where we give something to a museum and it involves us
						moving it – I’m going to give the museum the object, they’re going
						to take custody of it, and I’m going to physically move it from my
						house to the museum. So now, that one event is three different
						things happening. &lt;With&gt; all of the possible combinations of
						those it starts to get very complicated, and if we didn't use
						multiple instantiation we’d have a model which was very, very
						complex. That's precisely what the relational models all did, and
						that's why they became so phenomenally complex. By breaking it down
						into simple things which we can combine together to produce the more
						complex cases, we don't have to produce an incredibly complex data
						structure with lots and lots of rules around it. We just bolt
						together the pieces that allow us to tell the story we want to tell.
						While we have multiple isAs for classes – for the things that we’re
						interested in, for the properties that link them together we also
						have an isA hierarchy - I’ll show you that for some of them a little
						later. This allows us to capture different levels of abstraction, so
						I can talk about somebody / something being involved in an event or
						an activity, and then I can go all the way down in very great detail
						to: “This person was involved in this activity in this role.” So I
						have different levels of complexity, but if I want to do a general
						search, I want to know about <em>all</em> the different ways that
						somebody could be related to this event or activity. So instead of
						having to make very complex queries I can have an isA hierarchy that
						says if you just want a general relationship between an activity and
						a person you can query at this level, and it will include all these
						other properties which link them together in special ways. So
						multiple isA for properties gives us the same power about how things
						relate to each other as we use for the things themselves. &lt;As
						for&gt; methodological aspects, we only introduce an entity or a
						class where they are anchors for properties, where they are
						structurally useful. So we don't have lots of things that we could
						think of if we were having a really good day thinking about things
						we don't see in the real world, which aren't useful for us to hang
						actual properties and relationships between classes on, for the
						things that we actually seen in our data structures. Mostly, this
						stuff is built from the bottom up - we've gone and looked at all
						these different data structures, and extracted from them the things
						that are common. This is what we actually do, and we’ve added to it
						a few things that give us structure, which allow us to combine
						things where we needed them in order to hold the stuff that the
						different data structures actually have. So we've linked things
						together that way. But in the real world we often see shortcuts -
						quick ways of getting from an object to something, for instance.
						Let's take an example: when we look at this object we can say that
						it's “so long”. In my database I will have a field that says
						“length”, and it's 6 cm long. Now what we’re actually saying is that
						there was an event where somebody measured this object. In that case
						it was me, and that measurement was of the object, and produced the
						dimension “length of Stephen's clicker” and it gave it a value of 6
						cm. I can take a shortcut which goes from the clicker straight to
						the dimension - 6 cm - or I can say there was a measurement event in
						which Stephen measured it using this technique, and produced a
						dimension of its length, which was 6cm. The shortcut allows me to
						represent what we actually see in data structures without producing
						the events, where that would introduce too much complexity. However
						we can always add the event, so if later on I found a notebook about
						all of the things that I've measured, the techniques, when I did
						them and what measuring stick I used and so on, I could then
						incorporate that information into the rest of my data by using the
						join that is the event of me measuring. So I can add in all of those
						extra pieces of information, and that's my hook, the event is the
						hook. These joins allow us to represent what we actual see in data
						structures, but give us the ability to do the long way round without
						any problems. It’s there as well, and the shortcut tells us that the
						long way round is there, exactly what it is and the definition of
						the shortcut, so that I can do the long way round and add in
						<em>other</em> data flows, other data streams to give me my richer
						environment over time.

				<div class="chapter" id="slide-14"><h2>Slide 14</h2>
					<p>
						Let's now look at how we use multiple inheritance in order to remove
						complexity. This is one of the things we said we did in the previous
						slide, so why do we do it? Let's take the more traditional single
						inheritance: here I’ve got a museum artefact, and I’ve got a field
						for the museum number, for the collection and for the material. And
						then I’m going to have canisters: things which we put stuff in.
						We’ve got the base and the lid to sit on top of it. We’ve got
						information about the number of the container and the number of the
						lid. Then we have a special type of museum artefact for
						ecclesiastical items, which belong to a particular church. So we
						have a field telling us which church they belong to, and then we
						have a special type of ecclesiastical item called a holy
						breadbasket. Holy breadbaskets have a base and a lid - a container
						and a lid. So I have a field for the container and a field for the
						lid. Now this means that the container and lid fields appear in two
						different places. If I want to find all of the objects which have
						containers and lids, I have to know to go and search in two
						different places. Obviously, as my types of objects grow, I will
						have to go and look in multiple places. I may have to go look in 20,
						30 or 40 places, and the queries that I therefore execute become
						very complicated. Now let’s take the multiple inheritance form the
						way we do it in the CRM. Here we've got the same thing – we’ve got
						museum artefacts, which have museum numbers, collections and
						materials. Then we have the concept of “canister”, which has a
						container and a lid, and we have the concept of an ecclesiastical
						item, which belongs to a particular church. But now, instead of
						“holy breadbasket” being an ecclesiastical item which has “container
						and lid”, I make holy breadbasket simultaneously “canisters” and
						“ecclesiastical items”, and that means that they inherit the
						properties of both “canisters” and “ecclesiastical items”. So my
						holy breadbasket belongs to a church
						<em>and</em> has a container and lid. Now this greatly simplifies
						things; because I am using <em>these</em> container and lid
						properties, I can get at holy breadbaskets by searching for the
						general “canister” properties. And this means that as my data
						structure gets richer - and I have lots of different possibilities,
						I can move an object to a museum, give the museum the object, or let
						the museum look after the object (“change of custody”/ “change of
						ownership” and a “move”) - I don't have to have all the particular
						cases. I don't have to have “it moved to the museum but I didn't
						give them ownership” / “it moved to the museum and I still come in
						and look after it” - which is kind of unusual, but we could
						conceivably have that situation. I don't have to have all those
						special cases as different pieces in the data structure. I just have
						the concept of moving it, of acquiring ownership and of acquiring
						custody. Then I can add them together in whatever combination I need
						to give me the actual circumstances behind this particular case. So
						this allows me to greatly simplify things. However, it does mean
						that some object-oriented programmers get kind of nervous, because
						this is behaviour that they don't like. It is not traditionally used
						in object-oriented programming, but it’s perfectly acceptable in
						object-oriented modelling. So if somebody says: “Oh, you can't do
						that in object orientation,” what they mean is that you can't do
						that if you're an object-oriented programmer. So you can just gently
						persuade them that you're modelling, not programming, and
						consequently this is permissible behaviour.

				<div class="chapter" id="slide-15"><h2>Slide 15</h2>
					<p>
						Let’s have a look at an example of some data: this is laid out using
						XML and a simple access XSLT transform, which takes the base data
						and makes it look pretty, and we can automatically process this. As
						you can see as I go through it, we can actually read it as well, as
						humans, so we've got the ability to read the data
						<em>and</em> process the data from the same format, which is very
						handy. We don't have to translate it for us to read and for the
						computer to read. This is an example actually extracted from a
						document - a lament cloth - called Epitaphios 34604, which is at the
						Benaki in Athens. So here we have this object, which is a man-made
						object. It was a given to the Benaki - custody was transferred, and
						it changed ownership through this transfer event, which is
						simultaneously a transfer of custody and an acquisition event, so
						this is an example of that multiple instantiation we’ve been looking
						at. The custody was surrendered by the Metropolitan Churchly of the
						Greek Community of Ankara. So this is part of the exchange of
						populations that happened in the 1920s between Turkey and Greece,
						when all the Greeks in Turkey came back to Greece, and all the Turks
						in Greece went back to Turkey. The community objects were exchanged
						as well, so there was a Metropolitan Church church in Ankara, and
						all of the objects that belonged to that church were shipped back to
						Greece. They were put into the Benaki Museum and other museums, and
						the whole thing was overseen by a foundation called the Exchangeable
						Fund of Refugees, which was a government organisation that handled
						all of this. The custody used to belong to the Metropolitan Church,
						and it was given to the Benaki - they were going to look after this
						object for everybody. Now the owners of it used to be the Greek
						Community - the Metropolitan Church of the Greek Community of Ankara
						- but it was now going to be owned by the Exchangeable Fund of
						Refugees, this national foundation. Later on, the Exchangeable Fund
						of Refugees was dissolved, and the ownership actually transferred to
						the Benaki, but that was much later. So the original transfer – the
						title - was transferred from the church to the Exchangeable Fund of
						Refugees, which was a national foundation. Now this action, this
						transfer of the cloth, was carried out by the Exchangeable Fund of
						Refugees at some time between 1923 and 1928. Here is the time span
						for the transfer of this object, and it occurred some time between
						1923 and 1928, so this is the time primitive that we used to
						actually hook to time. It took place in Greece, that which is a
						nation, a republic that falls within Europe, and Europe is a
						continent. This is information we can extract from the TGN, so here
						we’re showing how we blended two different data streams to show a
						fuller set of information. That allows us to get at what Greece is,
						in case somebody didn't know - we can expand on our knowledge by
						bringing in information from another stream. Now you can see that
						this is <em>pretty </em>readable – it’s a little stilted in its
						English, but we’ve chosen the names of the objects and the names of
						the properties so that we can read them reasonably well. They’re not
						perfect under all circumstances, but most of the time it reads as a
						sort of fairly formalised English. In addition, because we are able

						simple document, the computer can process this. It's both
						machine-readable and human readable in one format, which is very
						nice, it’s a nice elegant solution.

						What does the CRM consist of? Well, it consists of these top level
						classes. This is the very upper level of the CRM, and if you
						understand this basic diagram, you understand the CRM overall. It's
						pretty straightforward: at the core of it are these temporal
						entities. These are events, things happening in the past, and these
						are where we join together everything, so we are an event-centric
						model, and this is the top of the event-centric subclasses, the very
						top of all of our events. It provides us with the <em>only</em> link
						to time - we don't allow objects or people to be linked to time, we
						only allow events to be linked to time, and people or objects or
						places to be linked to those events. So events happen within some
						piece of time, and they happen at places. Places are interesting,
						and we’ll talk about them again in a little while, but places are
						<em>not</em> something you can take a photograph of: a place is the
						mathematical construct of where something is. The inside of my
						wedding ring is a place – it’s a mathematical shape we can describe.
						It’s <em>not</em> somewhere on the face of the Earth necessarily. It
						<em>might</em> be, but it could be the front of a ship, or the top
						of this table, or the front of a painting, or the back of a coin.
						All those things are places and they’re mathematical descriptions of
						where it is, <em>not</em> the stuff that’s there at a particular
						point in time. We’ll come back to that and I’ll show you some more
						detail about it in a few minutes. So the thing happens, the event
						happens at a point in time and at a place, and we can have actors
						taking part in it. Now actors are anything which we can consider to
						have legal responsibility for what they do: individuals – you and me
						– we are actors, but also groups of people. Whether they are a
						formal group of people, like a company, or an institution like
						FORTH, or whether they’re informal groups of people – a “school” of
						artists, for instance - we could consider a group. So actors are
						individuals or groups of individuals who can do stuff together. They
						affect <em>things</em>, and we can divide the world up into two
						types of thing: physical things that you can smash windows with, and
						conceptual objects - those are things that are the products of the
						human mind. The big difference between them is that physical things
						can be destroyed. By destroyed I don't mean that they cease to exist
						and they become energy, because that would mean there would be a
						fairly big bang every time something got broken. What we mean is
						that they're taken out of our sphere of interest, so we no longer
						want to document them. If I take a desk and I break off its legs and
						make it into little pieces of wood, and I'm not going to record what
						happened to those little pieces of wood, then it's been destroyed
						and it’s no longer part of our domain of documentation. However, if
						I take something apart into its component pieces and then I keep
						track of them – I take the legs off and I start tracking the legs -
						they've not been destroyed. The table has not been destroyed in the
						sense we talked about, it has been transformed into some other
						things. We’ll talk a little bit more about that in a little while.
						Now, conceptual objects can’t be destroyed, because they’re a
						product of the human mind, an idea. Consequently, we can't destroy
						them – all we can do is destroy the last carrier of them. If I’ve
						got them written down in books and I burn all the books, so nobody
						can remember what was written in the book, then we've lost a
						conceptual object, but if we found another carrier with it on, then
						it’s suddenly back. The carriers don't have to be books or CD-ROMs
						or floppy disks or computer drives; they can be the human mind. The
						CRM, for instance, is held in many people's minds and on many hard
						drives, and many copies of it have been printed out, and it's on
						CD-ROMs and floppy disks all over the world. So in order to destroy
						the CRM I'd have to gather together all of these copies and
						printouts and burn them all. I’d have to destroy everybody’s hard
						drive and all of the CD-ROMs that it's been put on, and then I'd
						have to go and shoot everybody who could remember it. So I’d have to
						be shot, of course - and now, because you've seen this diagram and
						you can remember it, I’d have to come out and shoot all of you as
						well, which is a bit drastic really. So I think the CRM is going to
						survive for a while. Conceptual objects can only be destroyed by
						losing the last carrier of them; physical objects can be destroyed
						by making them into small enough pieces that we’re no longer
						interested in documenting them. That’s it basically - we've got
						events, we've got actors, we’ve got places, time spans and the
						things that we act upon - the physical objects and the conceptual
						objects that we act upon. That’s the base structure of it, but we
						have a couple other things that we like to do. Humans tend to like
						to give things names, so you give your pet dog a name, you don’t
						just refer to it as “dog”- you give it a name. And we are constantly
						making names for things. Those names themselves are things that we
						can study the history of. So what we provide for is the ability to
						name absolutely everything <em>and </em>keep the name as an object
						itself, so that we can study the history of the use of the name, its
						derivation, how we’ve recorded it and how it's been used over time
						as a subject in itself. We think it’s very important to
						differentiate between the <em>thing</em> and its name: I'm not
						Stephen, I’m a <em>thing</em> which is called Stephen. We
						differentiate that very core – it’s a very central theme to the
						whole of the CRM - we differentiate between the things, their
						identity and their names, because I can have many names: I can be
						Stephen; I can be Stephen Stead; I can be Steve Stead; I can be S.
						D. Stead; S. Stead and so on. All of those are names that apply to
						me, and other people can use those names, so for instance my
						grandmother is also S. Stead - Susan Stead. So the same name can be
						used by different objects and we can study the use of the name
						independent of the things that have that name applied to them.
						Appellations are something which are worthy of study themselves, but
						can be applied to everything that we have. That’s one overarching
						ability that we have. In addition, as scientists we tend to classify
						things: one of the driving forces behind science is that we want to
						organise things in some way and classify them, and we provide for
						that by allowing us to type everything, so we can add a type to
						every type of object that we have in the CRM: we can give things
						their classes. Classes or types can be applied on a one-to-one
						basis, but many people might classify a particular thing in
						different ways, so I might have many different classification
						systems from different organisations. Different research questions
						might classify something in different ways, so we allow types to be
						applied to everything multiple times. I can have as many different
						classification systems simultaneously classifying one object as I
						want, and this gives me a great deal of power. In addition to that,
						the types themselves are conceptual objects, so this allows me to
						have “types of types”, and “types of types of types” if want. I can
						be as deep as I want to be, but it allows me to discuss how the
						types have been derived, how they’ve been documented, how they've
						been used over time. In the same data structure that I used to
						discuss the objects I'm interested in, I can discuss how I’ve
						classified them and named them over time. So the names, the types
						and the objects all sit in the same data structure. That means that
						when we migrate, when we lift our data out and move it to a new
						system or put it into a digital repository to preserve it over a
						long period of time, I can use the same data structure to
						encapsulate the data <em>and</em> all of the stuff that I used in
						order to classify my data and name it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let me give you an example of how this is useful: in the 1970s,
						there was a big project in Southampton in the UK to work on a
						collection of mediaeval pottery. This mediaeval pottery was
						classified in a great deal of detail and measured very accurately,
						using a variety of measures: the size of the shards, what percentage
						of the vessel was there and a whole range of other very detailed
						pottery research. All of this information was stored on the
						Southampton City Council mainframe, their big computer, and it was
						marked as being of vital importance that this data was preserved.
						But space on the mainframe was very expensive, storage space on the
						mainframe and processing space on the mainframe was very expensive,
						so everything was very heavily coded. There were codes for the
						fabric, codes for the form, codes for which part of the vessel the
						shard was from. Then all of the different measurements were put into
						fields which were just the right size, and they were strung together
						into a long string for all the different shards of pottery. All of
						that was loaded up on the mainframe and the initial research was
						done with it. The initial research was completed and they were going
						to maintain this data. Religiously over 20 years, 25 years, they
						kept the data. The mainframe migrated from one version of its
						operating system to another, they very carefully migrated the data
						and checked that they could read it. Every year the tapes were
						exercised, spun off and spun back on so that they could check that
						they could read the data off the tapes, and it was all maintained
						<em>religiously</em>, so after 25 years we could still get all of
						the data.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then somebody came along and said: “Oh! I know about that dataset
						and I want to use it, because I can do some new research with that.
						There are some new questions that I want to answer, and that data
						will have all the information I need to extend my research beyond
						the set of shards I'm currently working on. I can look at this other
						big catalogue of shards which was done in the 70s, so I’ll get the
						data off the mainframe.”
					</p>
					<p>
						So off he went and asked for the data, and they loaded it up onto
						the mainframe and they I pulled it off for him and gave it to him.
					</p>
					<p>And he said “So what do these codes mean then?”</p>
					<p>
						And the guys who ran the mainframe said “We’ve no idea! That wasn't
						our job, we don't have a record of what the codes meant. You’re
						supposed to have that.”
					</p>
					<p>“But I don't have that.”</p>
					<p>
						So we had this beautifully preserved data and we didn't know what it
						meant. It was absolutely 100% accurate, it was just the same as when
						it went into the system, but we’ve got no idea what it means because
						they've lost the manual which tells them what the codes are. Scary -
						what we can do with the CRM is - because we can hold all of those
						codes, all of those desk instructions, all that information about
						how we’re storing information in the same data structure as the data
						itself - it means that when we move it we move everything. We move
						all the codes; we move all of the documentation with it, so that we
						can access the data and actually use it when we move the data.
						That's one of the great things about the CRM: it allows us to
						capture all the desk instructions, all the coding, all the naming in
						the data structure and tell us what it all means. So that when we
						get the data, we’ve got everything we need &lt;in order&gt; to
						understand it embedded in the data with it, and that makes a huge
						difference if we’re trying to digitally preserve things over the
						long term. That was a story about 20 – 25 years; if you were trying
						to do that over one hundred years, where there is not even a chance
						that you might find something who can remember it, or a thousand
						years, if that’s the goal of some of our digital library projects,
						then we have to encapsulate all of the meaning, all of the desk
						instructions, all of the codes into the data itself. Otherwise, as
						soon as it goes out of living memory, we’re dead. Because the
						chances of managing to keep the actual instructions, the actual
						terminology lists, the thesauri and the glossaries with the data –
						well, there’s no chance of it over long periods of time, because
						people will forget to do it, you’ll forget to preserve some
						document. Consequently, the data becomes useless, and all that
						effort you’ve put into preserving it is wasted. We don’t want that
						to happen, so the CRM provides us with the functionality to capture
						the data and the data around it. All of our desk instructions, all
						of our metadata can be embedded in the same data structure and
						carried around with it, which makes it of very great utility for
						digital preservation.

						Within the CRM we have different types of relationships between the
						classes, and we can broadly give you the types of those, though
						we’re actually going to deploy them in different ways for different
						classes within &lt;the CRM&gt;. Generally speaking, we have the
						ability to give the identification of real world items by real world
						names. That’s the appellations that we’ve just looked at – the<a>
							E41
						</a>
						<a id="_anchor_1" href="#_msocom_1" name="_msoanchor_1">[a1]</a>
						appellations –it just means that everything can have a name. And
						then we can classify everything - again this is E55 types we’ve just
						talked about. There is a general rule that everything we have we can
						classify, we can add a type to it. We also provide for part
						decomposition, so we can talk about the parts of it: I can talk
						about the actors that make up a group; I can talk about the
						different pieces of a table; I can talk about the different pieces
						of a chess set. I can also break down periods: I can talk about the
						Early Bronze Age and the Late Bronze Age. I can talk about parts of
						places: I can talk about this room being in this building, being in
						Heraklion, being in Crete and being in Greece, so I can break down
						place. And I can break down time, so I can talk about the beginning
						of this lecture, the middle of the lecture and the end of the
						lecture as being different time spans. So I can break all of this
						down. Now obviously &lt;with&gt; actors, when we break down actors
						we’re talking about groups of actors, we’re not talking about
						ripping my leg off so that we’ve got a bit of me as being a part
						decomposition. We don't go to quite such ridiculous extremes. We
						talk about the “participation of persistent items”. What’s a
						persistent item? A persistent item is something that I re-identify
						without watching it the whole time: I can look at this clicker, and
						if I hide it behind my back and bring it back you know it's the same
						clicker. So it’s a persistent item, it has identity over time,
						independent of me continuously observing it. That produces a useful
						set of properties - we can talk about things that are persistent.
						And these persistent items can participate in temporal events - by
						physically being there if it’s a physical object, or by having a
						carrier of it be there in the case of a conceptual object. So I can
						talk about the order to advance as being present during a military
						manoeuvre, or the Declaration of Independence being present at the
						celebrations of 4 <sup>th</sup> July. These are things which are
						conceptually there, there are carriers of that idea present at the
						event, or physical things at the event. By using this idea we can
						create this notion of history as a set of world lines. I talk about
						the object travelling through time and space, participating in
						events, and it’s that participation that gives me their meeting with
						other persistent items, which allows me to tell stories about the
						involvement of things. I’ll show you some graphics of that in a few
						minutes. <em>Periods</em> are very different to the periods that we
						tend to think about, where a period is just a chunk of time. Periods
						in the CRM are very specific: they are a cultural, social phenomenon
						bounded in both space <em>and</em> time. So you can't talk about the
						Roman period, you have to talk about the Roman period in northern
						Italy, or the Roman period in southern England. You have to say
						where you're talking about that cultural-social phenomenon, because
						the cultural-social phenomenon will have different temporal bounds
						at different places. In southern England the Romans were there for a
						far different period of time than they were in northern Italy: they
						started much later and ended much sooner. So you have to say
						<em>where</em> and when a particular social-cultural milieu was
						present. It could be that you have multiple social-cultural milieus
						present in the same place at the same time. We can talk about a
						nomadic community being in the same spatial area as a pastoral
						community, where one group of people live and work the land and
						don't move around, and another group of people move around in the
						same physical area, &lt;or a&gt; much bigger area at the same time.
						But they are different periods, they are different social cultural
						phenomena.
					</p>
					<p>
						We can talk about periods being located in space-time: “Where are
						they and when are they?” and physical objects be located in space:
						“Where is this clicker, where is …, where am I? Where are we doing
						this lecture?” We can have a loose idea of the influence of objects
						on activities, on products and vice-versa. I can talk about a dress
						being made for a wedding: the event of creating the address was in
						order to support a particular wedding. Or, generically, I can talk
						about the general class of events that something is made for. So we
						have this general feeling of influence between events, and objects
						and events. Finally, information objects can refer to anything, so I
						can talk about any real world item and say that this piece of
						documentation is about it, that this book is about this clicker -
						I’ve written a whole book about this clicker. This lecture - the
						video of this lecture - is about the CRM, so I can talk about the
						information objects referring to real world objects, things that
						we've identified in the CRM’s class system, instances of the
						classes.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-18"><h2>Slide 18</h2>
					<p>
						So let’s have a look at the big one - the thing that drives the
						model - the temporal entity hierarchy. This is all the different
						things that are temporal entities. Right at the top of the tree
						we’ve got temporal entities -
						<a>
							E2 temporal entities - which we looked at in the middle of the
							previous diagram
						</a>
						<a id="_anchor_2" href="#_msocom_2" name="_msoanchor_2">[a2]</a>
						. It breaks down into two different pieces: we can talk about
						periods, the social-cultural phenomenon bounded in space and time,
						and condition-states. This is where we talk about something being in
						ruins between 1950 and 1975, so it’s the state of something over a
						period of time. Periods break further down into events, and we’ll
						look at what extra pieces we get here. A that period is a
						social-cultural phenomenon, whereas events are where we start to get
						things being present at, so we don't talk about the clicker being
						present in a period, but we start talk about it being an event. Now
						every event is a period; it just depends on what scale you're
						looking at things. A wedding could be an event or it could be a
						period – it’s a social-cultural phenomenon bounded in space and
						time, a wedding. But it could be an event, because we’re going to
						start talking about people being at it, objects being at it as well.
						Then we have a class of things which are the end of things, the end
						of existence: people's death, the dissolution of groups, the
						destruction of an object; and we have the beginning of existence of
						things: the formations of groups, births of individuals, the
						creation of products of our mind. And we can also talk about the
						production of something: we make something. And then we have the
						general class of <em>activities</em>: this is where people are doing
						stuff. The different things that we can do are: we can modify
						something or produce it - we consider production to be a special
						case of modification - we can move things, we can transfer custody,
						and acquire them - that's the transfer of ownership - curation
						activities for looking after collections of objects. After all, one
						of the main movers in the creation of this has been being museums,
						so obviously we’re interested in how we curate museum collections,
						and we have a special activity for that. Joining and leaving groups:
						I can have a group of people and new people can join it and people
						can leave, so those are activities that people take part. And we
						have this general class of attribute assignment, where we say: “This
						is where I said that this is a clicker, so I classified this as a
						clicker, I gave it an E55 type and I can say who said that, when
						they said it, using what criteria.” That's the general case of
						attribute assignment, but we have special cases. &lt;There is&gt;
						<em>type assignment</em> – I’ve just classified that, it’s a special
						case. We have a special class for that. &lt;There is&gt;<em
							>condition assessment</em
						>, where we assess a condition-state.
						<em>Identifier assignment</em>, where I give this a number, so
						somebody gave this a number: this is item number IOWWZ9005 - that's
						the serial number given to it by the manufacturer, so they did an
						identifier assignment. Typically, identifier assignments are when we
						absorb the object into a museum. When it’s absorbed into the museum
						we will give it an identifier that museum is going to use for it.
						Objects will, over their life, have many identifiers assigned to
						them. One one of the important things to remember to do in any
						information system is never discard identifiers, because somewhere
						or other somebody will have used that identifier to identify the
						object. If you no longer have a record of &lt;the fact that&gt; that
						it used to be called 27 and now it's called 72, then anybody who
						referred to it under its old name will not be able to get out that
						data again. So you have to keep a record of all of the identifiers.
						And identifier assignment allows us to say when things happened and
						who assigned the identity: we can look at the history of the
						identification of the different numbers and letter strings that have
						been applied to an object over time, so that we know which
						identifier was used by which person at which time. And then there’s
						the <em>measurement event</em> – when we were talking about the
						length of this clicker earlier on, we were using an E16 measurement
						activity in order to take that measurement. Now there are a couple
						of interesting things here: E11 <em>modification</em>,<em
						> </em>which is a superclass of production - production is the
						beginning of the existence of something and it's also an isA
						modification - modification and transformation have very similar
						characteristics, but there is a key difference. One of the key
						things that we need to look at here is the difference between
						modification and transformation. In a modification we change the
						matter of something, but we don't change its identity. Here, for
						instance, we take a laptop computer and we change the keyboard on
						it. We’ve changed its matter and it’s now made up of different
						components, but it's still the same laptop, it’s still Stephen's
						laptop. Whereas &lt;with&gt; transformation we don't change the
						matter, we just change its identity. So, for instance, when
						Tutankhamen <strong> </strong>is transferred from being Tutankhamen
						to being a mummy, it’s the same physical matter that makes up his
						body, but we change his identity from being Tutankhamen to being
						Tutankhamen’s mummy. There are not very many cases of that outside
						the architectural world, but architectural historians do that a lot.
						For instance, a building will be built as a windmill and then
						changed into a house and maybe then changed into a studio for an
						artist. And then it might be changed back to being a windmill. Or a
						building could be built as a hotel and then changed to being a
						private residence, and then changed back to a hotel, and then
						changed to a shop. So architectural historians are constantly
						transforming things, where the matter - the building itself - stays
						the same, but we change its identity because we want to look at it
						in a different way. Transformation is maintenance of the physical
						stuff that make it up, but changing its identity; modification is
						changing the matter and <em>not</em> changing the identity. There
						we're changing a piece of it, but it's still the same thing that we
						are going to document.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-19"><h2>Slide 19</h2>
					<p>
						That’s the hierarchy for temporal entities - let's move on and look
						at
						<em>what</em> a temporal entity is. All the way through the
						standard, we identify these classes and we say what they are. And
						it's not what you think the word means that matters, it’s what the
						scope note says it is. For each one of the classes we have a scope
						note, and this is a copy of the scope note for E10 temporal entity,
						so it says: “This class comprises all phenomena such as the
						instances of E4 (periods) and E5 (events and states) which happen
						over a limited extent in time. In some contexts these are also
						called <em>perdurance</em>. This class is disjoint from E77
						(persistent item). This is an abstract class and has no direct
						instances. E2 (temporal entity) is specialized into E4 (period),
						which applies to a particular geographic area defined with a greater
						or lesser degree of precision, and E3 (condition state), which
						applies to instances of E18 (physical thing). That is the definition
						of what it is - it doesn't matter what you think it is,
						<em>that</em> is the definition. So whenever you read a class name,
						you must know what the scope note is to know what we mean by that
						class. The upshot of this is that it’s limited in time; it’s our
						only link to time, it spreads out over a place or object and is the
						core of the model but these are just our interpretations, this thing
						is the text that tells us what an E2 temporal entity is. Every
						single class has a scope note, and that's what's in the standard.
						You must read those to understand what it is we meant. Every
						property <em>also</em> has a scope note, so everything that we have
						in the whole standard has these scope notes, which precisely tell
						you what we meant. When we do translations of the CRM into different
						languages - at the time of shooting this video there were instances
						of translations into Portuguese, German, Japanese, Korean, French, I
						lose track - lots - each has translated the scope note, but it
						doesn't translate the label. E2 (temporal entity) is E2 (temporal
						entity) whether you're reading this in Portuguese, French or German.
						The scope note is changed into the language to try and explain it to
						an audience who wants to read in that language, so these names are
						labels, they don't mean anything. It's the scope note that conveys
						all the meaning.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-20"><h2>Slide 20</h2>
					<p>
						&lt;Moving on to&gt; subclasses of temporal entity, we’ve got
						“period”, which binds together related phenomenon, the
						social-cultural phenomenon bounded in space and time. It’s where we
						can do inclusions, so this is where we add parts. Temporal entities
						don't have parts, they don’t have the beginning of the temporal
						entity and in the end of it, it’s only when we get down to
						<em>periods</em> that we can talk about the beginning and the end.
						It’s confined in space and time - bounded in space and time - and
						it's our basic unit for temporal-spatial reasoning. This is how we
						do temporal-spatial reasoning: “This happened before that; it
						happened next to it; before it, next to it and so on.”
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>Events</em>
						, which are below period, start to look at inputs and outcome. What
						went in? What was the output of the event? This allows us to talk
						about participation in the most general sense of people and the
						presence of things. Things are actually at the event. It gives us a
						weak causal reasoning, so we can say: “This caused this” in a very
						general weak sense. And you can think of each
						<em>event</em> actually being a <em>period</em>
						if you're looking at in sufficient scale. So a wedding is a period
						if you want to detail every little thing that happened at the
						wedding. You would look at that, &lt;so that&gt; you could conceive
						of the wedding as a period, and then each of the individual pieces
						of it as being events.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then below <em>event</em> we have <em>activities</em>, and this is
						where you start to add the intention: “I wanted to do this,
						because…”<em>Influence</em>: “This activity influenced that
						activity” and <em>purpose</em>: “This was in order to do something.”
						It &lt;also&gt; adds the use of tools, so we can start to say: “This
						design or procedure was used, this hammer was used, or generically
						hammers were used to do this. Or moulds were used to make
						something.” These are the types of things that we add in at these
						different levels - each time we go down a level in the tree, we add
						some new capabilities, new stuff. <em>Activities</em> inherit all of
						the things from <em>periods</em>, so here we can talk about
						inclusion: activities have the ability to be broken down into
						different pieces. &lt;For examples,&gt; we can talk about the making
						of this video: it had at the beginning some preparation, then we've
						had the activity of actually making the video - me standing here
						talking - and then there’ll be some post-processing, where the
						soundtracks will be cleaned up and the different tracks of film will
						be edited together to make the final product that comes out to you.
						We can do an activity of making the video, or we can talk about
						those individual pieces of making the video and bolt them together.
						<em>Activities</em>, because they are a subclass of <em>event</em>,
						which is a subclass of <em>period</em>, gain the qualities that we
						have given to period. The properties that allow us to do the
						inclusion topologies <em>come down</em> to activity.

				<div class="chapter" id="slide-21"><h2>Slide 21</h2>
					<p>
						Here are the main properties that we use to express those general
						things we’ve just talked about. An E2 temporal entity has time span,
						which is our link to time. Then the periods: we get <em>place</em> –
						“took place at” a place; <em>consists of</em> “a period”, which is
						where we can break it down into individual pieces, and
						<em>falls within</em>. There is a subtle difference between
						<em>consists of</em> and <em>falls within</em>.
						<em>Consists of</em> talks about things which are part of it - the
						Early Bronze Age, the Middle Bronze Age and the Late Bronze Age all
						form part of the Bronze Age, whereas <em>falls within</em> is a more
						generic thing - the 20th century contains my birthday, the date of
						my birth, but it's not a necessary part of the 20th century to have
						my birthday in it. We can talk about that looser relationship -
						<em>falls within</em> - or we can break it down into parts. Both of
						those capabilities are brought in with <em>period</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The events give us <em>participation</em>: <em>participant</em>,
						<em>actor</em> and <em>occurred in the presence</em> <em>of</em> are
						general relationships to persistent items. Remember that persistent
						items are those things that we can look away from and look back, and
						know it is the same thing, and they apply to both physical items and
						conceptual items. I know that it's the same poem, even though I
						haven't watched it the whole time. Persistent items are both
						material and immaterial things. Then we go down to
						<em>activity</em>, and now we can say that instead of just being
						generally there and involved, they actually did it, so this is
						<em>carried out by</em>. We also have the ability to say what role
						they had, so we have an additional property of a property, which
						says in what role they did. And then we have
						<em>had specific purpose</em>, so that I can talk about something in
						preparation for something else. &lt;For instance,&gt; I can talk
						about making a wedding dress was in preparation for the wedding of
						somebody, a particular wedding. Or I can have general purposes, so I
						can say: “The making of this wedding dress was to support weddings
						in general. I don't know which one it was for, it was just made to
						be used at a wedding.” Or: “This object was made to be used in a
						particular ceremony. I don't know which instance of that ceremony it
						actually occurred in. This is to a particular event, and this is to
						the general type of events that we can go to.”
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-22"><h2>Slide 22</h2>
					<p>
						We talked about the fact that there's an isA hierarchy for
						properties, and this is the isA hierarchy for the general
						participation. Right over here we have the most general form:
						<em>occurred in the presence of</em>. That’s a persistent item
						<em>was present at an event</em>, so if you remember we go back to
						here and <em>occurred in the presence</em> <em>of </em>(B12) is a
						persistent item at an event. This is that is that top level property
						relating those two. Then we can go down into more detail, and we can
						talk about <em>moving something</em>. Well obviously if I moved
						something, the thing had to be there. I can use a specific object
						and I can use specific techniques. These specific objects were used
						as a constituent, so I can use something as part of the thing I’m
						making, for instance. I can use this fork to be made into a bracelet
						- I can do use things to make parts of other things. I can
						<em>have participation</em> and then, in more specific cases, I can
						<em>leave a group separated from</em> or I can
						<em>be the mother of</em> somebody. Strangely enough, we don’t
						record fathers as a specific relationship between people – fathers
						are rather superfluous in births, so we don’t bother with them. We
						can carry out actions, and then we have the specific things to deal
						with – the transfer of title and custody – that we talked about
						earlier. I can <em>join a group</em>, I can
						<em>leave a group</em> (separated and added to a group), and then I
						can <em>dissolve a group</em>, <em>destroy an object</em>,
						<em>transform an object</em> and <em>die</em>. Obviously I
						participate in my own death – perhaps not today, though. Then we can
						modify things - I can <em>take things away</em>,<em
							>diminish things</em
						>
						or <em>augment</em> them. I can <em>add things</em> to something, I
						can <em>produce</em> something - make something - and &lt;with&gt;
						<em>brought into existence</em> I can <em>create a group.</em> The
						the birth of them brought into life: my birth brought me into life
						and was by my mother. I can create intellectual objects, and we have
						the special case of creating a type in my E55 typologies: this
						allows me to talk about who created the type, where was the type
						created if I’m making a thesaurus. So I can document the history of
						my thesaurus using this P135. So &lt;from&gt; the general case down
						to the very detailed cases. If I just want to know where somebody
						was involved, and I don't want to know in what particular thing - I
						don't want to know just about their birthday, I want to know
						<em>anything</em> that they were involved in, I could search for
						this and all of its sub-properties and get my death, my birth and
						who my mother was, and all of these different things, from just
						searching for the general case. Or I can go down and say: “I’m only
						interested in things where they actively did the thing, they
						performed it.” Or I can just say: “I’m just interested in things
						where they gave the title to another institution or another actor,
						perhaps to a museum. So I can search at different levels of
						granularity and I gain everything that’s below automatically, as
						part of the search mechanism. This gives me very great power for
						doing general searches, and then honing in to particular aspects of
						the behaviour of an individual or an object.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-23"><h2>Slide 23</h2>
					<p>
						As an example, I can look at <em>terminus post quem</em> and
						<em>terminus ante quem</em>. Here we have the famous meeting of
						Attila the Hun and Pope Leo I. Obviously this meeting happened after
						the birth of Leo I and of Attila: the birth of Leo I was before the
						meeting, and the birth of Attila was before the meeting. And the
						meeting happened before their deaths. Now Pope Leo I carried out
						this meeting, he participated in it, and he also participated in
						general in his birth. He was brought into life by his birth, and
						died as part of his death – it’s convenient if you die as part of
						your death. So if I know this date, then I know that this must have
						happened before it. But I don’t have to know precisely what the
						relationship is – I can take any <em>took out of existence</em>. So
						I can query for any object that participated in this meeting. I can
						look for the table as well as the people, and look for the
						destruction of the table as being something that happened after the
						meeting as well. By using the general case
						<em>took out of existence</em>, I can look for the dates when
						<em>anything</em> which was involved in this meeting was taken out
						of existence: the table, the people, the pen that they used –
						everything. I &lt;can then&gt; use all of them as limits on the
						dates of the actual meeting. This gives me a great deal of power
						without having to search every possible link between an object – in
						this case Pope Leo I – and its destruction. I can use the general
						case of
						<em>took out of existence</em>
						and find all things which were taken out of existence, which
						participated in this, and take the earliest one of those dates as
						being the latest date that the meeting could have happened. So if we
						had a meeting and immediately burnt the table because it was
						contaminated, and I knew when the table was burnt, I would know that
						the meeting happened before the table was burnt. And then I have my
						links, because these deaths, births and the meeting are all things
						that happened in time. They’re all events, each of them has a link
						through to time via a time-span and some dates we can associate with
						it. It’s a very powerful mechanism, and by using the general tree
						structure here, I get to do those queries at the highest level and
						get all of the specialisations below them automatically, because
						they're already defined for us in the standard. So we don't have to
						have very complex queries to find those specialised cases when we
						just want to use the general case.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-24"><h2>Slide 24</h2>
					<p>
						We can think of these events happening as world timelines, and we
						model all of these things as meetings, so all these events are the
						meetings of people and persistent items to give us a history. Here
						we’re going to investigate the life of Caesar. We have what we call
						a coherence volume - a block of space-time within which Caesar was
						born, and Caesar's mother was present at that, and Caesar started
						his existence, he was brought into existence by his birth. And then
						his life is this blue arrow through time and space, and he reaches
						the coherence volume of his death. Little did he know that he was
						reaching it, but he reached it. And he meets Brutus's dagger - in a
						rather brutal fashion hands - at he stops, that’s his death. The
						dagger continues on, because obviously the dagger was made before it
						stabbed Caesar, and it continued on after the stabbing. And then we
						also meet Brutus, so Brutus comes into this coherence volume; the
						dagger and Brutus and Caesar all meet; Brutus continues, Caesar
						doesn’t and the dagger continues. So we have this world line of the
						various objects. We’ve got a world line for Caesar's mother, one for
						Caesar, one for Brutus and one for the dagger. And then we have
						these volumes, which tells about the space-time within which these
						things met. So these boxes are the temporal entities in which these
						things met and that allows us to model historical events as though
						they were meetings between people and objects.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-25"><h2>Slide 25</h2>
					<p>
						We can also do this with things like depositional events, so in this
						case we're going to look at the eruption of the volcano on Santorini
						– Thera. We have some ancient Santorinian who comes along and builds
						a house, and we have a volcano which continues throughout. Then we
						have the volcanic eruption, which happens at a particular point in
						time, and the house stops being a house. The matter stays the same,
						so it’s
						<em>transformed</em> from a house into ruins, and we now have the
						lava and ruins instead of the house. This volume is the space-time
						in which the eruption happened, and we've converted a house into
						ruins, so we have a transformation here. We can look at things being
						deposited in an archaeological sense as a meeting between the thing
						that’s doing the depositing and the thing that’s being deposited.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-26"><h2>Slide 26</h2>
					<p>
						Another thing we can look at is not just the physical things we can
						model this way. We can also model information. Here we have the
						great Battle of Marathon, and the story which forms the reason for
						the modern running of the marathon. There were a bunch of soldiers
						who fought the Battle of Marathon and they won. This is the
						coherence volume for the Battle of Marathon and the famous victory,
						and then we have this runner, who sets off. He participates in the
						battle, and then sets off to take the information back to Athens. He
						reaches Athens, and the information object - the concept of the
						victory at this battle - is held in his mind and he gets to Athens,
						and he conveys that victory to an Athenian, to the first person he
						meets and then he dies. So his timeline stops, but the Athenian now
						carries the information of victory, because we’ve transferred that
						conceptual object from one carrier – the original runner - to the
						new carrier - the first Athenian he meets. And they go on and pass
						that information to another Athenian, so the next person learns it
						and we now have
						<em>two</em> copies of that conceptual object carried in
						<em>two</em>
						people's minds. Then it obviously escalates and everybody gets to
						know about it, right the way down to us knowing about it. Each of
						these meetings where we’ve transferred the information from one
						carrier to another – it could have been written down, of course, or
						we could have written it onto a CD-ROM or typed it into our
						computer, those are all &lt;instances&gt; where we are adding
						another carrier to that conceptual object – each of these meetings
						happens in this coherence volume and then the information object
						carries on, the conceptual object carries on. In these two cases the
						carrier - the person - carries on as well. But in this case we
						passed it on and the first character died. So now we can think of
						exchanges of information, the movement of conceptual objects, as
						being a series of meetings between carriers and the conceptual
						object. And we can pass them on by having an event or an activity
						which creates a new copy in some new carrier: writing it down or
						transferring it from mind to mind by telling. So we can use the same
						conceptual mechanism to deal with many different types of historical
						activity.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-27"><h2>Slide 27</h2>
					<p>
						How do we deal with time? Well, we use this general model that an
						event is <em>not</em> a point in time. There is no such thing as a
						point in time: something always has duration and so we consider it
						to be a curve, a probability curve of that event happening at this
						particular time. We can add some boundaries to this: if we know it
						happened “after here” and “before here”, so after is “this way” and
						before is “that way”, we know that is at “sometime within”. We call
						these the outer bounds. We have a property that allows us to say
						that at some time within, the thing that we're interested in
						happened, so it gives us the outer bounds of the possibilities of
						that thing happening. We might also know that it was definitely
						occurring at a particular point somewhere in there: the thing lasts
						for a week, and we know it was definitely on this day, but we don't
						know whether that was the first day of the week that it happened or
						the last day, so somewhere in these two weeks it happened, and it's
						a week long. That is the duration here, but it was definitely going
						on on Tuesday 1<sup>st</sup>. This is the way that we’re going to
						deal with it: we’ve got what we call the <em>inner bounds</em>, the
						<em>outer bounds</em> and the <em>duration</em>. By using those
						three mechanisms we have the ability to talk about events happening
						where we don't know precisely where they happened - we don't know
						perhaps quite what their duration is but we have a general idea of
						it. In addition to this we also have the traditional Allen
						operators, which allow us to say that something happened after
						something else, or all began at the same time as something else but
						finished before the other thing finished. All of the Allen operators
						for temporal relationships are also available within the standard.
						This allows us to relate to time primitives, but we can also do
						relative dating, so we can say: “This happened before that” as well
						as: “This happened sometime within these bounds, or definitely
						covered these inner bounds.” Inner and outer bounds plus relational
						algebra for temporal extents are all available within the standards,
						so we’ve got a very good ability to deal with the various types of
						dating we see from archaeological and historical sources.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-28"><h2>Slide 28</h2>
					<p>
						Let's now consider the Time-Spans property, and how it relates to
						other things. The time-span is itself a CRM entity: these double
						arrows show the isA relationship. A Temporal Entity is a CRM entity,
						the time-span is a CRM entity, and we also have the Time Primitives
						and the Persistent Item being CRM entities. A time-span can fall
						within itself or be contained by another time-span – that’s the part
						decomposition. The temporal entities have the time-span, and the
						time-spans relate to the time primitives ongoing throughout, which
						are the inner bounds, and At Some Time Within, which is the outer
						bounds. We can have names for the time-span – we can have time
						appellations, a special class of the E41 appellation we looked at
						earlier, applied to the time-span. And then we have a period, which
						is a particular type of temporal entity – an event or a type of
						period, a sub-class of period. And we can have the Falls Within and
						Forms Part Of breakdowns of period. And then we have Condition State
						as the other top-level sub-class of Temporal Entity. Period is
						bounded by place, Took Place At. These are all of the relationships
						we’ve looked at individually, but now in a graphical format that we
						can use to try and explain how they interact with each other, and
						give us some idea of the way different classes are related to other
						classes, and the properties that do the relationships: the isA
						property and the specific properties, the P properties that we have
						within the model.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-29"><h2>Slide 29</h2>
					<p>
						We’re also going to look at inheritance - the E7 activity we visited
						before - and we’re going to show how it inherits properties from
						further up the tree. An activity is an event, is a CRM entity, but
						it goes via temporal entities, so we use this dash line to show that
						there are some things in between. The E55 type is a CRM entity as
						well, but are some things in between. A CRM entity has the ability
						to have a note attached to it, and we have the general case of an
						E62 string, which is a type of primitive value. We generally think
						of an E62 string as being as a string of text – that’s what we’re
						used to in databases. But we have a more general concept of string
						within the CRM, so this could be a string of text, but it could also
						be a photograph or a video file or an audio file - any binary large
						object or ‘blob’ can considered to be a string. Everything that we
						have in the E1 CRM entities can have a note, and the note has a type
						and we can say that this is a public description of it / a museum
						description of it / an audio file of her showing what the bird
						sounds like / what the bell sounds like when it's rung, or whatever
						the type pointing to the string is. This means that because E1 CRM
						entity has this ability to have a note, that E7 activity - which is
						via event an E1 CRM entity - can also have a string. So I can have a
						description of that activity, or the sound of that activity, or a
						film of that activity attached to the activity via the P3 Has Note.
						CRM entity also has this P2 Has Type, which allows me to classify
						everything – this general case P2 Has Type is attached - so I can
						type my activity. “This type of activity is bell making” or “Running
						around uselessly – oh sorry, football”- we can attach any of these
						things here. In activity we also have the new property P14 Carried
						Out By. Remember we had General Participation P12 up at the event
						level, and then when we got down to activity we had the more
						specific Carried Out By property, so here is the property Carried
						Out By. I can point from the activity to an actor, an individual or
						a group of individuals who are going to perform this activity. I can
						then say in what role they were doing that activity, so we could
						have me as the presenter, or the photographer, or somebody who is
						paying for a church to be built, or the architect or the builder.
						All of these different roles in the activity can be differentiated
						by saying that the activity was carried out by somebody in the role
						of architect, in the role of photographer, in the role of sponsor
						and so on. There is another high-level thing attached to E1 CRM,
						another high-level property, which is P1 Is Known As. This allows me
						to link appellations – the general naming that we talked about when
						we looked at the big slide of the overarching view is also
						implemented as a property of E1 CRM entity, so that everything
						inherits it.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-30"><h2>Slide 30</h2>
					<p>
						Now were going to look at activities of measurement, which
						introduces the concept of shortcutting. Here is my measurement,
						which if you remember was a specific case under attribute
						assignment. An attribute assignment is a special class of activity,
						and I can assign the attribute to a particular thing. Any E1 CRM
						entity can have an attribute assigned to it, and assign the
						particular attribute. So here I am producing a triangle and the
						thing that I'm applying it to is an E1 CRM entity. In general cases
						I assign the attribute to it, but when I’m doing measurement I'm
						<em>measuring</em> that thing. I observe the dimension - so this
						observation, the dimension, is a sub-property of Assigned. Measured
						is a sub-property of Assigned Attribute To. And then the dimension
						itself has a measurement unit – centimetres, stone, colour, whatever
						it is – and a number associated with it. This was 6cm long, so the
						measurement unit would be centimetres and the number would be six.
						This is the shortcut: P43 Has Dimension, which allows me to say:
						“This thing has this dimension”, without producing the measuring
						event in between. This is the shortcut directly from the object to
						the dimension. I can optionally put in the measurement: it depends
						on when I'm creating my data from my original data structure. In my
						original data structure I’ve just got a field that says length, and
						in my desk instructions I’m told to fill that in in centimetres. So
						when I take that out and make everything explicit within the CRM, I
						say that the measurement unit is centimetres. That doesn't appear in
						the database, that only appears in the desk instructions that tell
						me what to put in that field, and the number that’s in the field.
						Then the dimension is Length Of This Object, but we don’t know what
						the measurement event is. There is no mention of who did this
						measurement in the original database, so I can just shortcut it to
						the thing. If, however, I think I'm going to integrate this with
						another datastream - say the lab notebook to the person who does all
						measurements - then I could create this measurement event ready for
						me to hook that other datastream into, because that reference from
						my workbooks would have the object number that is associated with
						the thing that that I did the measurement of. So I’d be able to link
						through and say that this measurement, the measurement of object X
						occurred, and then I’d be able to say who did it, when they did it,
						what the temperature was and the weather, because that would
						obviously affect the measurement. For example, if I’m measuring some
						paper, the paper changes dimensions depending on how humid it is, so
						I could say what date it was done on; under what conditions of
						humidity; what measurement technique I used; which instruments I
						used to measure it with. I can include all of that from my notebooks
						about the lab techniques that were used in this event. But if I
						don’t have that information and I'm never going have it, I don't
						need to bother creating the measurement event, I can just go
						directly from the thing to its dimension. So it gives me an option
						as to how I’m going to integrate data. mention they given options to
						how I am going to integrate data and which data I’m going to
						integrate along the way.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-31"><h2>Slide 31</h2>
					<p>
						That’s measurement - now we can go on to condition assessment, which
						is where I'm going to carry out the activity of assessing the
						condition of a particular thing. I can have the activity of
						condition assessment being the overarching activity, but it might be
						broken down into many subparts, and again I can use the ability to
						talk about different pieces of the activity. I can talk about the
						preparation for the activity; the first part of the measurement; the
						second part of the measurement; the third part of the measurement;
						the finalisation of it, by having different sub-activities within
						the condition assessment, and these could each have a different
						type, saying exactly which technique am using and so on. It &lt;the
						measurement assessment&gt; concerned this physical thing and
						measured this condition-state. Then I have a shortcut &lt;called&gt;
						Has Condition, so that if I don't know any information about how we
						assessed it / who assessed it / when they assessed it &lt;and&gt; in
						the database I just have the statement that it is “Good” condition,
						then I can just go straight from the Physical Thing to the Condition
						State and say Has Condition. This makes what we actually see in real
						life databases easier to translate into this, and it means I don't
						have to generate lots of condition assessment events which I’m never
						going to use to do anything with. It allows me to do simplification
						of my mapping.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-32"><h2>Slide 32</h2>
					<p>
						Now we’re going to talk about acquisition. This brings in a
						different type of shortcut – a specialised type of shortcut. Here we
						have the note capability and the type capability we’ve seen before.
						We have an event, and then we go down to an activity, and now we’re
						talking about the acquisition. Here we have <em>two </em> links, two
						properties, from acquisition to actor. One is who transferred the
						title - Transferred Title From - and then who the title was
						transferred to, so there are two different instances of actor, one
						of which gave up the title and one of which received the title. This
						is the reason we have <em>two</em> links between acquisition and
						actor, showing us different things. The acquisition transferred the
						title OF this physical thing. These two shortcuts are special
						instances, and really illustrate the difference between different
						desk instructions producing different mappings within the CRM. If I
						have a field which says that somebody owned an object - they have
						ownership of the object - and I don't maintain that field, I fill it
						in when I first get the object, but I don't ever bother to update
						it, then I have the case that I have Former or Current Owner, so the
						actor is the former or current owner of the thing. But if I
						religiously maintain that field, so that every time the ownership
						changes I go back into the database and I update, it then I have a
						much stronger statement to make: Is the Current Owner Of. So the
						difference between these two fields isn't the relationship between
						the field Owner and the object – the thing that the record in my
						database is about – but it’s actually the way I maintain that field
						that’s important. If I keep it up to date I can make the P52
						statement, but if I don’t keep it up to date or I
						<em>don't know</em> whether I keep it up to date, then I have to
						make the weaker P51 statement. These are trying to encapsulate not
						just the data structure and what goes into the fields, but also how
						we maintain the data. So when we encapsulate the data in the CRM,
						we're actually encapsulating not just the data and the thesauri and
						wordlists we use, but also <em>how</em> we maintain that data. It's
						all being included, so that when we ship the data out to somebody
						else, they'll understand what it is that we're saying. They have all
						the semantics of the database - they get the desk instructions, the
						thesauri <em>and</em> the data all in the same structure, so they
						don’t have to go and look something up to find out what it is - it's
						in the data that they get. That’s quite an important extra
						functionality we have in some of the shortcuts. Now obviously this
						doesn't matter if I have a series of acquisition events. If every
						acquisition is documented and I know who gave up the title and who
						gained the title through the acquisition events, and we have the
						time that these happened, then I’m able to show a complete history
						of the ownership of the object. It’s only when we
						<em>don't</em> have this information and we only have
						<em>this</em> information that we can differentiate, or we
						<em>need</em> to differentiate between the two different ways of
						looking at the data &lt;and&gt; how we maintain it.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-33"><h2>Slide 33</h2>
					<p>
						Moving – here’s my physical thing. It has a former or current
						location, which is the weak statement, and a
						<em>current</em> location if I’m constantly maintaining the
						information. &lt;Then&gt; we have Moves, which will move something
						from somewhere to somewhere, and the thing that we're moving
						obviously. And then there’s this extra thing – an extra shortcut
						which really labels this as a museum standard. It’s one of the few
						things that is museum-only: the concept of Has Current Permanent
						Location. The current permanent location is where the object should
						be if it’s not somewhere else. The idea is that we will have a place
						in the store, in the basement of the museum, where the object would
						be put if it wasn’t on display. In some museums, the object could
						never be in that current permanent location, because they use it as
						a way of doing their inventory control. So you’ll get shelf marks
						for a little bit of shelf – a two-inch length of shelf – in which a
						400 tonne steam engine is supposed to fit. And that’s the current
						permanent location, so the object may never have been in its current
						permanent location, it’s just where it should be in theory if we
						taking a stock control of it. That marks this as a museum standard;
						it's one of those things that <em>only</em> museums are interested
						in. But we can ignore it if we don't need it for what we’re doing.
						So if we’re trying to use the idea of a move outside a museum -
						within an archive, say, or if we’re looking at a library or if we're
						talking about a medical database - then we just don't need to use
						that property, because it’s optional.

						This is the general map of Making Things, so we have Modifications,
						and the special case of that – Production, where we’re going to make
						something. If we’ve modified it or made it, it is necessarily
						man-made. We can use designs or procedures in order to say how we’re
						going to do it, how we going to make it. Designs or Procedures were
						originally only for Modification and Production, but we’ve now
						realised that we can use designs or procedures for any type of
						activity, so it's been generalised to give us the ability to say: “I
						measured this using this procedure, I acquired it using this
						procedure, I assigned an attribute to it using this procedure.” So
						we can do all sorts of things with Designs or Procedures.
					</p>
					<p>
						Designs or Procedures <em>might</em> use a material as part of doing
						the Design or Procedure, even though that material doesn’t end up in
						the object. If, for example, you’re doing lost wax casting, where
						you make a wax model and then put clay around it to form a mould,
						and then you melt the wax out so that you can put the metal in to
						actually create the casting, then there is no wax actually in the
						final product, because we’ve taken it all away to create the void
						that we’re going to actually put the metal into to make the casting.
						So we can talk about a Design or Procedure using material, even if
						that material doesn't end up in the final object. This gives us a
						great deal of sophistication for the way we model production
						techniques and map modification techniques. Obviously, modification
						is an activity, so we can talk about an actor carrying out the
						modification or production in a particular role: we can talk about
						the artist, the caster, the engraver &lt;or&gt; the various
						different roles there are in producing or modifying something. We
						can have a whole variety of different roles, and we store all of
						those different roles in the E55 Type class, so that we have a set
						of classes &lt;or&gt; types of things within the E55 Type which
						relate to the roles that people can perform particular activities
						in.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-35"><h2>Slide 35</h2>
					<p>
						Now when we we’re actually producing the standard, we have two ways
						of showing you what properties a particular class can have. In the
						published standard - the ISO document - we only show the things that
						are declared for a particular class, and these are the things that
						are in bold here. Here’s the declared property of E11 Modification:
						P31 Was Modified By, a physical man-made thing. This modification
						acted upon this thing, this physical man-made thing, which, if we
						look back to the previous diagram, is this relationship here: P31
						Has Modified. That’s declared as part of the definition of E11
						Modification, but remember that Modification is an Activity &gt; is
						an Event &gt; is a Period &gt; is a Temporal Entity &gt; is an E1
						CRM Entity, so it gains all of the things that it has inherited from
						there. Here is P1 Is Identified By, so I can give it a name; P2 Has
						Type, so I can classify it; P11 Had Participant, as opposed to
						someone who did it, which was down at the activity level - P14
						Carried Out By. Occurred In the Presence Of; P16 Used Specific
						Object, so I can say that I used this particular mould for doing my
						lost wax casting, for instance, and in what mode. All of these
						<em>other </em>things I’ve inherited from further up the tree. We
						don’t show those in the very small ISO document, but we do have a
						different version of the document where all of the inherited
						properties are listed. That's available as a text document or it's
						available as an HTML document, where you can zip around inside it.
						Just by clicking on P12 Occurred In the Presence Of, it will take
						you to the definition of P12, so you can just check the scope note
						to make sure that you understand it - you can whistle about in it.
						All of these inherited properties we list in <em>italics</em>, so
						that you understand they came from higher up the tree. But the ones
						that are actually declared for this class are in
						<strong>bold</strong>. In this list we’ve got inherited properties;
						declared properties; some more inherited properties; another couple
						of declareds; some more inherited; and another declared. E11
						Modification in the ISO document will just have the four statements
						underneath it; within the more useful, more friendly document with
						all of these things in - in the HTML version - you get all of these,
						and all of the classes and property names are hot-linked through to
						the definition of that class or property, so it’s very quick to move
						around. This is very useful when you’re first using the standard, as
						you're getting used to things, because you don’t have to hold all
						137 properties and 86 classes in your head before you can use it.
						You can use this document and whip around inside it, to very quickly
						find your way around. Then over time you'll have to do it less and
						less, as you get used to where things actually are.

				<div class="chapter" id="slide-36"><h2>Slide 36</h2>
					<p>
						This is a general case for the way we can change things. This is
						talking about modification, where we can do part addition: I can add
						a piece to it, add an extra leg to my table to make it into a
						five-legged table. Or I can do a part removal: I can take the fifth
						leg away and make it back into a four-legged table again. I can
						transform things, where I’m changing the identity but maintaining
						the material, as opposed to a modification where I’m changing the
						material but <em>not </em>changing the identity. These are all
						happening to persistent items - things I can look back at and know
						are there - physical, man-made things we’ve had some kind of human
						interaction with, that we’ve modified. So that tells us about how we
						modify things or transform.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-37"><h2>Slide 37</h2>
					<p>
						And here we have another case, where we're talking about taxonomic
						discourse. We’re talking about how we create the typologies that we
						use to classify things. The concept of a type is a conceptual object
						- it's a product of our mind. So we have the activity in general;
						the creation event which allows us to create the conceptual object –
						that’s where we think of something - and then we have the special
						case of that, which is the type creation, where we’re creating a
						type, generating the concept of a particular E55 type. We can create
						type in that - here’s my E55 type which was created by it. But I can
						<em>use</em> real world objects in order to help me think of that.
						Particularly, say, in Natural History, I’ll have a particular
						example of “the bumble bee” or “the insect” that I’m going to create
						the type for. So I will say: “Was based on a particular instance of
						this insect.” And I can say what <em>role</em> that object was used
						in doing that, so I have this taxonomic role; I can say it was a
						lectotype. This particular bug was the lectotype for creating this
						type. Here’s my type creation, I used this particular bug as a
						lectotype to create this type. I can then point back at the thing
						and say: “This is the one that was used in the role of lectotype to
						allow me to create this,” so I've got full control of exactly how I
						created the type and which objects were used to help me create the
						type. I have full documentation of the way my thesauri were built up
						and how I created this stuff. So when I export it and I want to look
						at that date again, in 15 years time or 30 years time or 150 years
						time, I know exactly how the typologies that were used to classify
						the data were created. They may have long since been superseded, and
						if I want to use that classification in my research now, I need to
						understand how that classification happened. This allows me to
						document the metadata that goes around it - the procedures and all
						the classification systems, completely and thoroughly – and
						incorporate it into my database, export it. So I’ve got everything
						about how I used it. And then of course I can then actually classify
						something with the type using my type assignment, so I’m actually
						saying: “Right, this one … this is a clicker, this thing in my hand
						is a clicker. But I can also talk about <em>how </em>I developed the
						concept of a “clicker”, and which object I used as my type specimen
						for saying: “This is what clickers are.”
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-38"><h2>Slide 38</h2>
					<p>
						We’ve talked a lot about physical and immaterial things, material
						and immaterial things, so it’s a good idea if we actually look at
						the structure of what these things are. This is the tree structure
						showing the hierarchy of physical and conceptual objects that we
						looked at at the very top level in that original diagram. Here’s a
						thing – we can have legal objects, that is objects that can have
						rights on them - those are things like ideas which can be reused -
						identifiable reusable physical things and conceptual objects. We can
						have man-made things: obviously all conceptual objects, all the
						products of the human mind are man-made, but some physical objects
						are not man-made, because we could be documenting natural materials
						from a natural history museum, for instance. We could be documenting
						a rock sample, as an example. We have physical things, and then we
						get physical man-made things. We also differentiate between physical
						objects - these are things which have real boundaries. This clicker
						is a physical object, whereas the writing on the side of it is a
						physical feature, in that there’s no real way I can pick it up and
						transfer it around. So things which are generically holes or
						scratches we would consider to be features: a canal is a feature, a
						cave is a feature, but this clicker and a table are objects, and
						they can be both natural. A cave is a natural feature, a boulder is
						a natural object. We can have physical man-made things, and they
						divide into man-made features and man-made objects, so that we have
						objects which have been made by somebody and features that have been
						made by somebody: if I cut something into a rock, that’s a man-made
						feature. We have biological objects - a special case is of course me
						as a person – I’m a biological object. A bumblebee, an insect, a
						lion, the tiger that we had earlier, and a snake are all biological
						objects. Then we have the special case of a site, and that's where
						we've taken a physical feature and we’ve just drawn a line around
						something and said: “Right, this is the site.” So any kind of
						arbitrary distinction, so-called fiat object in space, is a site.
						Now you remember we talked about Place being the mathematical
						construct on the surface of some larger constellation of matter: the
						inside of my wedding ring; the back of the coin; or the Earth. Here
						is the difference: the site I can take a photograph of, because it’s
						the particular stuff that’s at a particular site at a point in time.
						So I can photograph sites, but I can’t photograph places. Many
						people find that a useful way of distinguishing between a place and
						a site. Site is the stuff that’s at a place at a point in time, so I
						can photograph it, whereas the place itself is just a mathematical
						shape; it’s just a definition of where stuff is, I can't take a
						photograph of that. Collection is a set of man-made things which
						were going to curate in some way: a collection in the way museums
						talk about collections, or archives talk about collections. Another
						special case of man-made object is an information carrier.
						Information carriers are things that are designed to carry
						information. They don't have to have any information on them, but
						they’re designed to carry information: blank CDs, blank floppy
						disks, blank notebooks are all information carriers, whether they’ve
						had anything written onto them or not. However, if I gouge my name
						into a table or into a prison wall, that doesn't make the prison
						wall or the table an information carrier, because it was not
						intended to carry information. The fact it now does have my poem
						inscribed on it is irrelevant; it's not an information carrier. I
						can still represent the fact that it's carrying a copy of my poem -
						the properties are there - but it's not <em>designed</em> to carry
						information, so consequently we don't consider it to be an
						information carrier. Then we can go down to the immaterial things:
						I’ve got this nice red line to show that this is <em>material</em>,
						so this is things I can smash windows with, and this is
						<em>immaterial</em>, where if you know it I’ve got to shoot you –
						the immaterial world. We’ve got conceptual objects in general, and
						we break those down into propositional objects, things which
						<em>say</em> something about something, and symbolic objects, which
						are just the image. Normally, in a book we’ll have a symbolic object
						which <em>carries</em> the propositional object. We’ll have the
						<em>text</em> as it’s laid out, with a particular typeface, a
						particular set of spacing and a particular font - which is the
						symbolic object - and then the <em>meaning</em> is the propositional
						object that’s carried by that set of symbols. Because I could change
						the type face and it would still be the same propositional object,
						but it would be a different symbolic object. That's what these two
						allow us to talk about. Appellations are symbolic: they’re names for
						things, they don’t carry a proposition. They don’t say something
						about it - they’re just a name for it, a reference to it. If you
						think of the artist formally known as Prince, who changed his name
						to a symbol, that’s an ideal understanding of what's going on. His
						appellation - his name - was now this symbol, not a word, not like
						Stephen. That's the difference between an appellation as a symbolic
						object and this idea of carrying information - that there’s a
						proposition in there. There is no proposition in the symbol; it's
						just his name as represented by that symbol. Information objects are
						a combination of a propositional object and a symbolic object, in
						that they're carrying information in a particular form on to the
						outside world. Information objects – the stuff that’s in the book –
						is a combination of the typeface and the layout <em>and</em> the
						thing that’s being said in those words, in those pictures or
						diagrams. An information object is a combination of both symbolic
						and propositional objects. And then we have these various
						classifications, these various sub-classes of it. An E31 document is
						<em>not </em>a novel. An E31 document is a very technical use of the
						word document. What we mean by an E31 document is something that
						deliberately sets out to document something in the formal sense of
						documentation. So it might be that it isn't text: if I take a
						photograph of a museum object with the intention that this will
						document the museum object – so that I’ll know what it is and what
						state it's in, and I can re-identify it - that’s an E31 document,
						even though there’s no text in it at all. I could have a sound
						recording of a bell, which is intended to document the sound of that
						bell ringing, and that would be an E31 document, even though it has
						no text and it's only playable as a sound file. So E31 documents
						intend to document something. And then we have a special case of
						that - an authority document, which documents our types. So this is
						where we can create our thesauri, which tell us what our different
						types are. This is the authority document that documents the types
						in a formal sense. Then we have the Designs or Procedures - how we
						do something - and we have general case of Linguistic Objects, which
						are our texts and so on. &lt;Then&gt; we have special cases of
						Inscriptions, and a special case of Title. Title is the name of a
						book or a painting or something like that, in the formal sense that
						it's a name, but it's also a Linguistic Object. Really, what we're
						saying here is that the title can be translated. If the appellation
						of a thing can't be translated, &lt;if&gt; you can't say
						<em>The Blackbird</em>, or whatever <em>The Blackbird</em> is in
						French - it’s gone straight out of my mind – then it’s not a title,
						it’s just an appellation. “Stephen” has no translation, so it's just
						an appellation. But if I have the name of a book which I can
						translate into another language then it's a title in the formal
						sense of a title. I also have Visual Items down here. Visual items
						can be images or they can be marks, so there we’re talking about
						trademarks and little symbols, like the red triangle for Bass Beer
						and so on. They might be inscriptions, they might be scratched into
						something. All of these are immaterial ideas. We’ve talked about
						type a lot – type is a conceptual object, and we have special cases
						of type: Measurement Units, so we can talk about centimetres or
						furlongs or pounds or kilograms. Material: things that we used to
						make stuff, but we’re not interested in documenting the individual
						thing. And this produces an interesting choice of scale. If I am
						documenting building materials, I'm probably not going to document
						every kilo of sand that was used to make up a building; I’m probably
						not interested in which kilo of sand came from which bit of which
						desert to make the cathedral. I’m probably not interested in each
						individual brick that makes up a fairly standard 1930’s townhouse,
						and I'm not going to record the manufacturing process of each
						individual brick. They would be materials, because I’m not
						interested in documenting the individual pieces, I just want to
						document the fact that this type of material was used. I want to
						document that bricks were used, that sand was used, that thatching
						was used – reeds to make the thatch on the roof. But if I'm
						interested in Roman bricks, each individual brick is of vital
						importance to me, because I’m going to record: how it was made;
						which type of stamp it has on it; which techniques we used; which
						clay was used, from where, in order that I can actually produce a
						really detailed understanding of the way Romans made bricks. So it
						depends on my research question or questions at what level I draw
						the line between something being a material and something being
						worthy of documentation. One person’s database might document things
						that another person's database would just consider material, and the
						nice thing about the CRM is that we don't care. We don’t tell you
						where to draw the line; we can just absorb your data no matter how
						you’ve done it. So if you consider gold to just be a material that's
						fine, but if you're interested in tracking every individual gold
						nugget that came out of a particular panning operation or mining
						operation, we can do that as well. We don't care what your research
						question is, we just allow you to include the data that you've
						generated as part of documenting your research question into the
						general milieu of information across the whole of the cultural
						heritage domain. I’m going to deal with appellations in a couple of
						slides, so I’m going to leave that bit out, because I’m going to go
						into that in a little bit more detail in a few minutes. But that’s
						covered all the different pieces of the physical world and
						immaterial world, except for appellations.

						Here’s a little bit more detail about the Actors. The actor is
						somebody or a group of somebodies who have responsibility for their
						actions, and they’re divided into E21 Person – remember we just saw
						that E21 Person was a subclass of Biological Object, so as a person
						you are both a biological object and an actor.&lt;As for&gt; the
						groups, we also break down groups of individuals into legal bodies.
						Legal bodies are groups which have some legal identity. The FORTH
						Institute is a legal body, the UN is a legal body, but a group of
						people acting as a collective might not have legal status.

						E53 Places we’ve talked about a few times now. A place is an extent
						in space, so it’s just the mathematical limit. It’s diachronic, and
						it doesn't matter when that mathematical limit is true all the time.
						It’s always relative to some larger persistent constellation of
						matter, so the persistent larger constellation of matter might be my
						wedding ring. The inside of my wedding ring is a place, but it
						doesn't have a latitude and longitude; I can't give a UTM coordinate
						for where my ring is, and in the course of this lecture I've moved
						around lots and lots of times. But the mark on the inside of the
						ring which tells me who made it and what type of gold it's made of
						is always on the inside of my wedding ring, no matter where my
						wedding ring is. So it gives us the ability to reason about where
						something is even if we don't have a grid co-ordinate, as many
						databases insist on. So we can talk about things on the bow of a
						ship; an African dinosaur footprint which is currently in Portugal,
						because when the dinosaur made the footprint it was in Africa, and
						that piece of Africa is now Portugal in Europe, so &lt;though&gt;
						it’s moved it’s still an African footprint; and where Nelson died,
						which is inside the <em>Victory</em>. I have no idea where Nelson
						died as a lat&lt;itude&gt;-long&lt;itude&gt;, because the ship was
						sailing around with him in it, but I know precisely where he died
						because there’s a plaque there and I know precisely where it died
						givers a plaque there that says: “He died here” and I can go and
						point to it. That’s now in Portsmouth, in the dock in Portsmouth.
						Well obviously he didn't die there, he died somewhere in the Bay of
						Biscay, but I know where it was. So that gives me this idea of
						place; I can point to the place relative to some larger
						constellation mapped. Now of course many of these, when we’re
						talking about archaeological sites or architectural buildings, are
						to do with a continent. We're saying: “It’s on this continent.” But
						we can also talk about the front of a coin, or the the top left-hand
						corner of a painting, or the bottom right hand corner, where
						somebody’s signature is. So it doesn't matter where I hang the
						painting, the signature is always in the bottom right-hand corner of
						it. That’s what place does for me.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-41"><h2>Slide 41</h2>
					<p>
						The properties of place give me all sorts of capabilities. I have
						the ability to name it: now that name could be an address, it could
						be a place name, it could be the spatial co-ordinates to it, or it
						could be a section definition, like the inside of my wedding ring.
						So here's the physical thing, and this section definition says it's
						the inside of this physical thing - my wedding ring - and that’s the
						place appellation which applies to the place where I'm going to say
						that this, the manufacturer’s mark, is. Obviously periods take place
						in a place. The period is then something happening, and that can
						take place at a place <em>on</em> a physical object. So we can talk
						about the <em>making</em> of that mark on the inside of my wedding
						ring. That is a modification event, which is a subclass of period,
						so it comes between production and period in this tree here. Here is
						the former or current location which allows me to talk about a not
						well-maintained database, saying where something is. I also have
						this section definition - Has Section - so I can shortcut going
						through the appellation route to get that physical thing, to say
						where it is. So I can talk about the inside of my wedding ring
						without going through the long route – I can use this shortcut to
						get to that.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-42"><h2>Slide 42</h2>
					<p>
						I said I was going to revisit appellations. Remember, these are
						symbolic conceptual objects. Here's my appellation – that’s the
						general case of appellation - and I have specific appellations for
						things which I know are actors. I can talk about actors’ names: they
						can be Stephen or FORTH…FORTH an actor appellation, the name of this
						institution. &lt;Then there are&gt; Identifiers, which are the
						identifiers for objects and things that we’re interested in
						studying. We can have rules for how identifiers are made up, and
						they’re covered in an extension to the CRM called Functional
						Requirement For Bibliographic References, Object Oriented – FRBRoo –
						that’s an extension that we’ve done already. Identifier allows us to
						talk about the strings of letters and numbers we used to identify
						things. We have Time Appellations, the names of periods of time, and
						the special case of that - the date. We recommend that you use the
						ISO standard for dates, where you put the year at the beginning,
						then the month and then the day, although you can use any layout of
						date that you want. It’s just that that is convenient because it
						sorts properly. You’ll notice when we created that example of that
						Yalta Agreement I was using, 1945-02-11, to make it sort properly.
						Conceptual Object Appellation, so if we’ve got a name for a
						conceptual object we can put it there. And then the special case of
						title, which - remember - are an appellation and a linguistic
						object, so we can translate them. Place Appellations – we just
						looked at those – place names, special coordinates, section
						definitions and addresses. And then we have this special idea of a
						contact point, so we can talk about <em>how</em> we gain access to
						an actor - how do I communicate with the actor? Well, that’s a
						Contact Point, and a special case of contact point is an address. So
						an address is both a place appellation and the name of a place that
						I can send information to. So if I want to post somebody a letter,
						then the address would be a contact point as well.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-43"><h2>Slide 43</h2>
					<p>
						Just to illustrate how extensions can work, this is an example of
						how we might extend the CRM to process some of the additional
						information that’s in the Getty TGN. The Getty records
						<em>more</em> information about geographic names than we do in the
						CRM, because that's not our research question. The TGN is the
						Getty’s research question about what places are called. We can add
						some extra things in, to help carry all of the data that is in Getty
						if we want to. We don’t have to, but it’s possible. So we can have
						this additional class which is place naming, where we’re talking
						about <em>who</em> named something, a particular thing. That’s
						obviously a subclass of attribute assignment. I can create a
						<em>new</em> extended subclass called place naming, and I link it
						into the existing CRM structure as an attribute assignment. Now,
						when I search for attribute assignment, I will get back all things
						which have been made into place naming, in a special extension
						database that’s been created. Then I can have some extra properties
						which link place naming to something. I can say that it assigns a
						name – I’ve got a place appellation assigned, and that’s a property.
						I can assign it to a particular community, and this place
						appellation is identified by a community. This community decides
						that this place appellation applies to a particular place, so that
						the community understands this place naming. I can say which group
						carried it out - it might be an official body that does it, or it
						might just be the people who live in a particular city &lt;and&gt;
						say that the city is called “this”. And it’s applied to a particular
						place, because obviously it’s a place name, it's applied to some
						place. So that’s the generic way of extending it.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-44"><h2>Slide 44</h2>
					<p>
						That’s the generic way of extending it, and then as an example of
						that extension we can talk about Nineveh, which has been known as
						two different names - Nineveh and Kuyunijk. The community of people
						who live in the city of Nineveh - the cultural, social phenomena –
						the people who live there over time, have done this naming. The
						group of people is the people of Iraq, &lt;they&gt; carried out this
						naming to this place, and here we’re referring to the TGN of it, to
						point to that. They've assigned this name at one particular point in
						time, and they’ve assigned <em>this</em>
						&lt;other&gt; name at a particular point in time. I can identify
						when that naming took place by attaching time-spans to this. Here we
						say that this one was applied in the 20th century, and this one
						applied at a different time arms. This social cultural phenomenon -
						the people who lived in that city – have a time-span of the first
						millennium BC. So I can say that this community identified Nineveh
						as Nineveh, but later on a different community has identified it as
						Kuyunijk, and now it has gone back to being called Nineveh. So I can
						model those different changes in the way people name things just by
						using this extension, but the extension is fully compatible with the
						original. So if I have data that uses the extension I can still
						search it using the mechanisms that are available to me for
						searching general cases of CRM data.

						Let's move on and think about visual content and subject. This
						allows us to talk about how we can depict something on something
						else. Now remember we talked about Information Object earlier, and
						we said an information object is something designed to carry some
						information, but we can also have other things carry information. We
						have physical man-made things, of which a special case is
						Information Carrier, and they information carrier is designed to
						carry something, but in general the desk that I’ve carved my poem
						into, or the T-shirt that I’ve got a picture printed on (maybe that
						is designed as an Information Carrier, who can say?) depicts, so
						this object has on it an image, it depicts some CRM entity. So we
						have the Information Object, which is being carried by this and
						refers to this: it could be a poem or could be a picture, whatever
						it is – if it’s a picture, it’ll be a visual item - and we have the
						special case of showing a visual item representing a particular
						thing. We also have the Mode of Depiction, which allows us to talk
						about a planned view of something, or an elevation of something: a
						particular way of showing an object as opposed to a style, I
						suppose. And then the Visual Image is where we’ve got an image which
						is a visual item, because visual item includes things like
						trademarks as well. So this is Images, this is more general case of
						any visual thing, including marks and trademarks and so on. This
						allows us to show the way we represent subject matter on anything,
						whether it's a general physical man-made thing or the special case
						of an information carrier.

				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-46"><h2>Slide 46</h2>
					<p>
						That’s really covered the standard, and the way we can do things
						with the standard, so now we need to move on to thinking about some
						of the applications of it. The first way we can use it is obviously
						to take the content of different data streams, different databases,
						research databases, and represent them so that we’ve made them more
						general, so that we can get at all of the implicit things that are
						in the data structure in the way we fill it in - in the desk
						instructions, the thesauri and so on. But when we do this kind of
						mapping exercise, so we understand what's in the original database
						and how we’re going to represent that on the CRM, we quite often
						find that a field in the original data structure has multiple
						meanings, depending on what data is actually in there. So we
						actually have to produce mappings which say if this field contains
						this piece of information, map
						<em>this</em> way; but if it contains a different piece of
						information, then map <em>this</em> way. Just to illustrate that,
						I’m going to show you how to do mapping of Dublin Core data to the
						CRM. I’m going to do that by showing you two example mappings: one
						for a piece of text and one for a painting. Here’s a piece of text,
						which just to be completely cyclic of course, is the text about how
						to do this process, about how to map Dublin Core metadata to the
						CRM. This was a report written by Martin Doerr: here’s the front
						cover and the front page of that report. It was published by this
						institution, ICS-FORTH, in their technical report series. It’s
						Technical Report number 274 published in July 2000, and it’s written
						in English.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-47"><h2>Slide 47</h2>
					<p>
						So how does that map to the CRM? Well, the report itself is a
						linguistic object, because obviously we can translate it. It has a
						name - the mapping of the Dublin core metadata element set to the
						CIDOC CRM - and it was created in a creation event by an actor whose
						name is Martin Doerr. Remember &lt;that&gt; we're going to
						differentiate between the person and their name, because Martin
						could be known as many things: he could be names Martin, or Martin
						Doerr, or M. Doerr, or Martin is originally from Germany, so if you
						have is spelling of his name correctly in German, it has an umlaut
						over the “o”. But he now lives not in Germany, and people don’t have
						umlauts in their typefaces everywhere, so consequently he has
						discarded the umlaut for ease when he’s publishing. All of those are
						different versions of his name, but it doesn’t change who he is. So
						we have this actor identity, and we’ve just used a random number to
						generate the fact that he is an actor. He is actor number one in
						this example. It was used for a publication activity which was done
						by another actor, which is ICS-FORTH. So this is the name of
						ICS-FORTH – obviously there are many ways of writing ICS-FORTH, in
						Greek, in English and so on. So those are all different versions of
						the actor appellation, but it doesn’t change the fact that it's this
						legal body act of specialisation of actor that has done it. We’ve
						given ICS-FORTH actor number 2. It’s identified by a conceptual
						object appellation: FORTH-ICS Technical Report 274, July 2000, which
						from external knowledge we can say is a fourth identifier, and we
						can use programs which understand the format of names in order to
						say: “Oh, that’s that type of name..”, if we have that kind of
						structure within it. And it's written in the language English, so
						this is a mapping of that Dublin Core record, making explicit all
						the things which are actually hidden in the original records. Back
						here we’ve got this idea of creator and publisher, and inside there
						are hidden creation events. We’ve just got a string, which is their
						name, but we know that they might be known by other names - other
						strings – so we’re going to insert proper actors there. First their
						identity, to which we’re going to apply the appellation, which is in
						the Dublin Core record. So that’s pretty straightforward – the way
						we do that.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-48"><h2>Slide 48</h2>
					<p>
						Let’s go and look at a painting and see how that differs. Here’s a
						Dublin Core record about this painting: it's of Type Image, Type
						Painting, two different typologies in use within Dublin Core, two
						different classification systems. It’s called
						<em>The Garden of Paradise</em> and it was created – well, we don’t
						know who created it, all we know is that they created it. So they
						are known as the master of the <em>Paradise Garden</em>
						. We have a name for them, we know who they are, but we have no idea
						who it really is. And it was published by the Staedelsche
						Kunstinstitut. Publishing a painting is very different to publishing
						an article or a technical report. What this means is that this
						institution was-were the first people to document it in a formal way
						and present that document to the outside world. They were the first
						documenters of this painting.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-49"><h2>Slide 49</h2>
					<p>
						So how does that translate into CRM? Well, now we’ve got an
						Information Object, it’s not a Linguistic Object, because it's not a
						text. So when we look at that field which says that it's an image
						instead of a text, we have to produce a different mapping. Here it’s
						an information object, and this happens to be the information
						object’s real number in the museum of this painting. Obviously
						that’s not in the DC record, and we just happened to use that
						because we know it. It’s got the appellation
						<em>The Garden of Paradise</em>. It was produced in a production
						event, which was carried out by an actor. We don't know the name of
						the actor, we just have the mater of the <em>Paradise Garden</em>.
						However, we do have a very precise identity for it, because the
						united list of artist names knows &lt;or&gt; has an identifier for
						the master of the <em>Paradise Garden</em> , even though we don’t
						know who it is. It’s a very precise identity for someone we don't
						know who it is. ULAN is another product of Getty, like the TGM, and
						this is the ULAN number for the master of the
						<em>Paradise Garden</em>. Here we go – that’s his unique identifier.
						Remember that when we were doing the technical report we just
						generated some random numbers. Here we have a third-party number we
						can use, which is a solid number – a good URI for the identity of
						that actor. In the first one, when we published it what we were
						talking about was actually publishing the document, but here
						publishing is about actually documenting the thing. It’s documented
						in a document which was created in a creation event by an actor who
						has an actor appellation - the Staedelsche Kunstinstitut. We say
						that this publication was a publication creation, meaning that’s the
						type of creation that it was. And the information object has an E55
						type of DCT1 image. Because it’s a DCT1 image, I can use external
						knowledge to process that, and say that it’s an AAT painting as
						well. By understanding this, I can add knowledge to it by merging it
						with another typology, another datastream. So at this produces a
						very different mapping to the mapping we had for text. By looking at
						a particular field’s value, I can determine that I need to do
						different mappings and different transforms of the data in order to
						produce valid CRM data that contains all the information that’s in
						the original datastream. So the mapping process not only needs to
						look at the data, but it also needs to look to see if different data
						values in the data produce different mappings for different types of
						object. This is one of the weaknesses of Dublin Core; it doesn't
						really show us all of that semantic richness in there, because it's
						only got a few fields. It's alright for its purpose, which was to do
						resource discovery, but it doesn't allow us to blend different data
						streams because the field used in different ways for different
						things. We don't have that same level of capability that we would do
						with the full semantic mapping we get with the CRM. But because the
						CRM is able to extract that information - all those implicit events
						and knowledge about how things are done - we can produce mappings
						which will take low specification data and actually enrich it into a
						semantically richer environment. So we can blend it with other data
						streams and mix it and still use it, even though it's not at the
						same level of granularity as the data perhaps from a very detailed
						art historians’ database about that particular painting, which is
						discussing the iconography of it, the techniques used on it, the
						different types of paint and so on. We could have very great detail
						in one place and much thinner detail in another, and be able to
						blend those different data streams seamlessly using the CRM to blend
						them.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-50"><h2>Slide 50</h2>
					<p>
						What lessons have we learned now from doing these kinds of mapping
						operations? The interoperability between different data sources can
						be defined by our ability to map the data structure. Data that’s got
						very poor or very thin structure is less semantically interoperable
						than data which has very rich structure. If you just get a piece of
						text about something with no structure in the text, we have very
						little ability to produce semantic interoperability with just that
						text, whereas if the data is all broken out of that text then we get
						much richer semantic interoperability, because the semantics from
						that free text have been extracted and made available to us to
						process. The mapping capability of a particular data source will
						show us how semantically interoperable that data source is. So if
						you use the CRM to help you build your data structures and you take
						a great deal of the CRM into your data structure, you know that you
						will have semantically rich data to pass to other people - you'll be
						semantically rich in your interoperability capabilities. The mapping
						of these types of networks is relatively simple. The databases are
						usually fairly flat, not very complex, and we reduce complexity by
						simplifying the data structures. So we have a field for artist,
						rather than having a field for the creation and who has created it
						and in what role; but we can extract very simply from that into the
						richer CRM context, because the rules for how that field is filled
						in are in the desk instructions. By using desk instructions we are
						simplifying our database structures to make it faster for people to
						work with. As long as those desk instructions are explicit, we can
						disambiguate the data and extract all those things which are
						implicit in the desk instructions out and make them explicit in our
						CRM data very easily, as long as we’ve got a copy of the desk
						instructions, as the Southampton story told us. It’s very important
						to embed your desk instructions and your thesauri into the data
						stream, so that when we export it we get everything: how you did it,
						as well as what you've done, &lt;i.e.&gt; the results of your
						research. We quite frequently find that we've got composite paths,
						so that for instance the artist and the date field for a sculpture
						both have part of the same path; so there’s the relationship between
						the object and its creation or its production and then somebody
						doing that production in the role of artist, and the time that they
						did it was the date. So the first part of the path is the same for
						both endpoints, and then we split out to do the different final
						pieces. And we find that that’s very common – that in the data
						structures we’re producing for our actual research work we’re doing
						these compressions, and we know we’ve done them, they’re implicit in
						our design, in our desk instructions. So we don't need to have all
						of these fiddly bits, because we know what’s going on. But when we
						want to make that shareable, we have to make those things explicit,
						and those composite paths are very common. That’s not something to
						be scared of, that's what we should be doing and that's the way we
						should design things, as long as we <em>know</em> that that
						composite is there and we can extract it on the fly as part of our
						export to CRM data. Along the way we’re going to make these nodes.
						Remember that we had the creation node and the actor node that we
						put into the DC records. We know we are going to create those, and
						so we just need to understand that we can create them as part of the
						process of building our original data source. If our original data
						structure mashes things together so that we can't produce individual
						nodes in these chains, then the data structure is not going to have
						high semantic interoperability. So we want to make sure that when we
						extract the data into the CRM format, we can identify those
						intermediary nodes uniquely and easily – they’re not two things
						crammed together. That makes things very easy, and then the
						cardinality constraints must not be enforced in the CRM and in the
						export. We may have / a person will have one father, but we might
						have knowledge about no fathers, one father or many opinions about
						who the father of somebody is, from different data sources. So we
						must not enforce those cardinality constraints to give us maximum
						interoperability; if we have many different opinions about who the
						father is, then we can carry them all in the CRM, we don't say:
						“There has to be <em>one </em>truth.” We give all opinions and then,
						as a scholar, I can make a decision about what's the most likely,
						&lt;or&gt; for all these opinions what's the most useful. We’ve also
						learnt from this &lt;that&gt; domain experts, cultural heritage
						people, actually learn this schema mapping very quickly. I run a
						tutorial for people to learn this: including doing this piece of the
						tutorial - what you're watching on video now – <em>and</em> going
						through and getting people to usefully do mapping, is two days’
						work. Half a day to do this, and then within a day and a half people
						are actually able to do mapping of their own datasets very usefully.
						However, if you give it to IT experts they don't really understand
						the desk instructions and the processes which are part of our
						cultural heritage internal culture: the way we do things. We all
						have shared frames of reference which IT experts don't have. So they
						find it actually quite difficult to do the mapping without having a
						domain expert as part of the team. In fact, &lt;it’s&gt; probably
						virtually impossible for them. They either completely underestimate
						it &lt;and&gt; they think it's trivial - and it isn't - or they get
						bored by it because they find it too detailed, and they spent too
						much time trying to find out meaning and it just swamps them,
						because they don't have that shared frame of reference that we all
						do as cultural historians. So that can mean that the IT expert
						should be at the periphery of this process, and that the actual
						driving force in doing the modelling are the domain experts, the
						people who actually know the material. They can rely on the IT
						experts to help them out with how they do stuff, but it’s them
						actually understanding their data, and the <em>way</em> they create
						their data that’s the most important thing as part of the mapping
						process. We do need more intuitive tools for helping domain experts
						do this, and this is one of the open research questions within the
						CRM domain: how do we make tools which are helpful and supportive of
						this process? How do we bring together different identifiers?
						There’s a working group looking at how to deal with the
						co-referencing problem which we &lt;saw when we&gt; looked at back
						at the Yalta agreement. That’s one of the problems we identified
						there. And how do we deal with different technologies and reference
						them to each other? If one group of people call this a “castle” and
						another group of people have called it a “fortified place”, how do I
						make sure that we understand that they're actually talking about the
						same thing, that they're just using different terminology for it? So
						we need to go through that process as well.

						Throughout its development history, the CRM has met other
						ontologies. We’ve found that we’re a little bit different from many
						of them. Many of these different other ontologies lack an empirical
						base. One of the nice things about the CRM is that it has not been
						built from: “I think therefore I am”, down to deducing the existence
						of fairy cakes. It’s all worked from: “These are the data structures
						that we actually use in the discipline, let's extract from those
						upwards and find the things that are common across all these
						different sub-disciplines, different data structures that we
						actually use, so that we are actually grounded in real practice in
						our domain, in our cultural heritage domain.” Some of these others
						don't have that, they're just thought of from very high-level
						concepts and drilled down towards concrete things. Along the way
						it's very easy to get lost, whereas working from the
						conceptualisations that we use generally, we’ve got a very firm
						base. They tend not to have sufficient richness in the relationships
						in order to get the functions that we require out of it; they tend
						to be processed by looking at different terminologies and just
						processing the terminologies, so they are very good at sub-classing
						things, but they’re very poor at how things relate to each other,
						because those are not things which are encapsulated in the
						terminology. And they don't have any idea of what they trying to
						achieve, whereas we do; we’ve got a very strong idea of what we want
						to achieve, and it has been driven from the types of things that we
						want to do within the cultural heritage sector. So we have a good
						specification of what we are trying to achieve - interoperability in
						this domain - we have a rich set of relationships, and we’ve built
						from a strong empirical base. It does mean that we miss things out
						which we don't document: museums don't tend to document things like
						contracts; that's not actually part of the way museums work, and
						archives don't document contracts per se. They document the piece of
						paper that’s the contract, but not the content of the contract
						itself. So we don't have concepts that are not in the databases from
						our domain. But it detects content that isn’t made into lexicons,
						into thesauri. So we have this idea of Persistent Item because
						that's something that we need to explain what we actually do. It's
						not something where we have a list of different types of persistent
						item out there in the real world; we just know that Persistent Item
						is something that allows us to hang a whole load of stuff off in our
						functional requirement. So we’ve got these things because they're
						functionally required - we need the idea of Persistent Item to make
						things organised. We need an idea of a symbolic object and a
						propositional object in order to organise things; we don't have
						lists of symbolic objects and lists of types of propositional object
						out in our domain. But we need them in order to make types,
						appellations and conceptual objects hang together properly. &lt;As
						for&gt; some of the different ontologies that we've seen out there:
						there’s Dolce, which is from a lexical base, and uses intuition and
						processing of terminology. It’s a very good, theoretically motivated
						logical description, good foundational relationships, &lt;but&gt;
						has over-specified relationships in many very detailed modes of
						participation, which we find too heavy. It has a bad model of
						space-time, so it doesn't have the ability to talk about outer and
						inner bounds, it doesn’t have Allen operators and things like that.
						But apart from that it’s got a strong overlap with the CRM, so lots
						of stuff there. BFO - I can't remember what that stands for - is
						from a background of philosophy. It has a <em>very</em> poor model
						of relationships, it's about classifying things and it believes the
						world has a deterministic underlying reality, which we don't
						necessarily believe. What we're talking about is our observations of
						reality, not that there is some real truth. All we have is all the
						things that people have said about the truth, whatever that is, so
						we are observational-based and they believe there’s some reality out
						there that they're trying to produce an ontology for. It’s a nice
						idea, but it gets a bit scary after a while. It means that it’s very
						difficult to verify it, because there is never going to be any data
						about what they're thinking about, because it's “truth”. No
						databases are about truth, they’re about observations. Again, it has
						a strong overlap with the CRM. Then there is IndeCs and ABC Harmony,
						which are small ontologies: event-centric like we are, very strong
						overlap with the CRM and we’ve completely harmonised with them, so
						that the CRM has everything that they have embedded in it. We did a
						lot of work with the teams which were working on that, and they’ve
						agreed that the CRM now covers everything that they wanted to cover,
						they’ve stopped development and have just started using the CRM
						instead. Then there is SUMO, which is just lots and lots of
						concepts. It’s a very large, high-level set of concepts, and there’s
						no functional specification underneath it at all. It’s not very
						useful for doing stuff, but it’s a great place to get ideas –
						concepts that are out there.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-52"><h2>Slide 52</h2>
					<p>
						Another application is &lt;that&gt; we have developed a thinner
						version of the CRM and which gives us the ability to OII harvesting
						of CRM-capable datasets into a semantically rich subset of the CRM,
						a bit like Dublin Core is used to harvest data. But instead of
						getting the thinly specified Dublin Core data, we’re going to get a
						rich, event-centric set of data that we can harvest. So it becomes
						far
						<em>more</em> useful for doing semantic discovery, whereas
						&lt;with&gt; Dublin Core you end up just doing string matching and
						hope. Here we’re actually going to have semantically rich data
						that’s been harvested using this core technology. This is an example
						of things that we can do from record: &lt;here&gt; is some data
						about this bronze casting of Balzac which was created by Rodin, but
						he created the original figure and it wasn’t actually cast until
						after his death. So although it's Rodin’s statue, it’s Rodin’s
						statue which was created after he was dead. There’s that process,
						that complex process is in there, and this mapping allows us to see
						that that is available. So we can represent that complexity, but
						using a very thin core set of the CRM.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-53"><h2>Slide 53</h2>
					<p>
						And this is the core set of the CRM – it’s the concept of CRM Core.
						It has events, and all the information we need to drive events. It
						has the ability to drive events; it has the ability to categorise
						and classify things, identify things – give them names - carry free
						text descriptions; and it has the ability to relate one thing to
						another. So we have the ability to do “relationship”, “parts of”,
						“referred to by” – all of those things that we saw at those
						high-level categories right at the beginning of the lecture, when we
						looked at the different types of relationship we could have. So it
						provides us with all that functionality, and there are a couple of
						really good papers on that if you want to look at it in more detail.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-54"><h2>Slide 54</h2>
					<p>
						Then we can create minimal datasets using the CRM Core. So we can
						have an artist record in CRM Core talking about their events, and
						then we can relate that back to the work, the actual Rodin's
						original plan study and then the casting, through these work
						carriers – here are the Information Carriers. Here we say that
						here’s the identification of Rodin, &lt;which&gt; points back to the
						person, and then here's his death, and that points back to his death
						in the person records. We can harvest information very easily using
						an event-centric model, and link it together outside the original
						data repositories to provide a fast way of doing semantic discovery
						- a semantically rich discovery - rather than just the text matching
						that we’d get if we’d extracted Dublin Core records, where we
						wouldn’t really understand the relationships between events and the
						things that are embedded in them, in records.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-55"><h2>Slide 55</h2>
					<p>
						What are we trying to do with the CRM? Let’s have a couple of
						examples. Well, we want to get at semantic integration beyond
						context. What we mean by this is that I don't want to have to stay
						in the confines of the original data source. Within the context of
						the original data source, all the semantic stuff is there: I’ve got
						my desk instructions, I’ve got my thesaurus, I’ve got my process,
						I’ve got the software and the screen design that helps me put the
						data in. So within that, I’ve got a rich semantic interoperability
						within the data elements which are in my institution. But I want to
						be able to step outside that context and link those pieces of data
						to &lt;other&gt; pieces of data, to tell bigger stories from other
						institutions. The other institution’s data is in the context of that
						institution, I want to get at what's in those datasets without
						having to be an expert in that context, an expert in the way that
						organisation does stuff, and know all the desk instructions for how
						they filled in the database. I want to make explicit all the stuff
						that’s implicit in the way they work, so that I can join those
						datasets together. We’re going to try and pull together all relevant
						sources and data, so that we can do an evaluation of a question
						which wouldn’t be answered by just looking inside one database. I
						want to ask questions which are orthogonal to the way I record.
						Let's take an example: I’m going to record a whole set of paintings,
						so I will have a workflow which allows me to record paintings. I'll
						start off with one of set of paintings and I’ll go through and
						record all the information about the painting: the size of it, when
						it was painted, who painted it, what colours they’ve used and so on
						– what types of paint and so on. And then I’ll have another database
						in another institution, which is going a look at the biographical
						history of that individual. They’ll talk about when they were born,
						where they’ve travelled to, who they’ve met and so on. Within each
						of those, I've got lots and lots of information siloed in the
						context of how it was recorded. If I want to ask a question that’s
						orthogonal to that way of recording: I want to ask a question about
						what iconography on the paintings that this guy has painted is also
						present in works by other painters that he either met before he
						painted this picture, or before they painted the picture that has
						the iconography in. We can look at how particular images, particular
						ideas in the iconography have spread. That’s a really difficult
						question to ask within the silos that we have, because the
						information about where he travelled and who we met is in a
						completely different context to the information about the
						iconography of the paintings. So I need to merge those two different
						data sources in order to start asking questions which cross the
						boundaries between contexts. That's very much what we're trying to
						do: bring together all of that information from all of these
						different sources, and allow ourselves to ask these grand,
						super-arching questions that go beyond the boundaries of any
						particular data repository. We can do this using the CRM, and it
						gives us integration on a scale that’s usable. The Core allows us to
						do this in a harvesting way, so we can use the full CRM or
						extensions if we want to, but to maybe just get a handle on the
						problem and start the discovery, we can just use CRM Core and a
						harvesting mechanism to get us a long way down the line, and
						actually start to produce really interesting results without having
						to go to several institutions and completely blend all of their
						data. We can use the CRM as a blender, if you like, that sits on top
						of it. It allows us to do mediation across these different things.
						These different data sources, if we were trying to merge them, would
						all have to be very similar in the depth of detail that they went
						to, and the depth of specification that they had, whereas the CRM
						allows us to merge things which are of very different levels. I can
						work with a national level inventory, which has very little detail
						about things, with the detail of a very specialised research
						database which is going into incredible detail about one particular
						aspect of the thing that the general database is only skimming over.
						I can have – in an archaeological context - I could use a national
						inventory, and the research database of the palinologist who looked
						at the pollen from the ditches surrounding a particular burial site.
						And there, I’ve got incredible difference in detail. One’s just
						saying: “Hey, there’s a burial mound”, and the other’s going: “And
						in this little sample of soil, there was an oak pollen grain. Now
						that's a massive difference in scale and a massive difference in
						specification. But with the CRM, I can blend seamlessly between the
						tow. And that gives me enormous power - so I can deal with things
						like Dublin core and highly specialised databases at the same time.
						And by creating this common understanding, I don't have to go: “You
						will recall this way!” and “you will record this way!” so that I can
						make the match. I can just allow you to record and do the stuff that
						you want to do - follow your nose for new research questions, tackle
						new issues and still seamlessly blend your data to produce much
						richer stories across this massive range of things. So I don't tell
						you what to record, because you are the people that decide that.
						It's what we can then blend. As long as you're informed in your
						design decisions by the CRM, we can then blend your data with
						everybody else's and produce really rich stories.

						This is what we've just been talking about, in that when we do
						scientific and scholarly work we produce knowledge by adding to
						what's already there. We add new bits of research on, and it always
						comes in closed units, in documents - whether that's a database or
						an actual text doesn't matter, it’s a document - and they will have
						a history of evolution. The database will be enhanced, the document
						will be enhanced, new understandings, &lt;there will be&gt; new
						editions and so on. But the knowledge is very directed, it’s very in
						tune with what the original research question was. So if I want to
						spread out, it’s quite difficult from that. And it can only be
						evaluated in the context of how it was created and where it was
						created, as we have already discussed. What we want to do is take
						these document structures, open them up and make them explicit, so
						that they are not tied to their original context and we can get at
						the information in them and allow us to integrate them with other
						things. A good way of doing it is to have a creator, a creation
						place and a creation date. A bad way of doing it is to have a
						“provenance”. What does that mean? How does that work? We don't
						know. Or “place associations”. “This thing it is to do with Milan” –
						well, why? How is it to do with Milan? What we do about Milan? Is it
						that it was made there, is it that it was used there, is it that it
						was bought there? We don't know, so we want to understand how Milan
						relates to this object and life cycle date – that’s a
						<em>poorly</em> defined thing, whereas if we’ve got a good
						definition we can very easily map between the document and the CRM,
						and extract the information and make it explicit and usable. Of
						course, a particular data source might not be complete relative to
						all the things we’re interested in. And that's one of the joys of
						using the CRM: I can have a silo of data which doesn't have
						information about biographical details of the artist in at all, it
						just has very detailed information about a particular subset of his
						paintings. I don't have to have <em>every</em> painting in that
						detail; I don't need to know the biographical data in order to deal
						with that particular set of research questions. But I can hook them
						up with all of that information from other places and spread it out,
						so that I end up with a much richer story line. So any particular
						data stream doesn't have to be complete, it doesn't have to be
						rigorous, spreading out and covering the entire world. I can take
						these different silos and blend them together to produce much richer
						stories.

						The CRM really gives us three different attacks on managing the
						knowledge that we have in our environment. The first area is: how do
						we acquire the data, how do we grab stuff, how do we digitize things
						that we’re documenting? How do we get at that data? The acquisition
						of that data can be motivated by the CRM - we design our databases
						as schemas, so that we can gather data which is then exportable in
						the CRM. But the CRM is terrible at doing data input, because when
						we are doing data input we need ergonomic front ends to the
						databases. We need things which are going to help us go through the
						process. If I've got 50 vases to record, I want to be able to call
						up a screen for doing vases which has things about vases on, has
						specialised thesauri for vases and so on, so that I can make my
						descriptions of the vases very quickly; I don't have to think about
						all of the possibilities, I just need to concentrate on documenting
						that particular class of object. And it will have constraints, so
						that I can't say that this vase is 2000 metres tall – because we
						haven’t got any 2000 metre tall vases. So what we can say is: “What
						he actually means is 2 metres tall, he’s just put the decimal point
						in the wrong place” - those kinds of helpful things. It will use
						language specific to what we’re doing - it's pointless getting a pot
						historian to use art historian’s terminology to describe a pot,
						because that's not the way they think. It’s got to be optimised to
						the specialist needs of the particular user group that’s going to
						document things with it. They’ll often work on a set of items which
						are very similar, so we can do the “copy previous record into this
						record” and then modify it. If you’re doing hundreds of the same
						vase, you can document in that way and just change certain values in
						it. This will typically have very low interoperability needs for the
						actual acquisition; acquisition is usually inside a context, inside
						an organisation, inside a particular research project. But if we can
						design this so that we can map it, maybe even as part of the
						original design of the application, then the data becomes usable
						outside. And that's where our primary target is: the integration and
						comprehension of all these different data streams into [??]. Here
						we’re trying to break the document boundaries, get them out of
						context and merge them so that we can tell bigger stories. We want
						to match shared identifiers, aggregate alternative views of the same
						thing - &lt;e.g.&gt; the different fathers from different sources -
						and we don't care about which direction we’re going to ask the
						questions. So if I go to my vase database, I’m going to ask “How
						many red vases do I have?” <em>NOT </em>“How many vases made by
						so-and-so after this date include this piece of iconography and are
						red, blue or green?” So I have a much wider set of search choices in
						this richer environment, and this <em>must</em> be interoperable to
						be useful. That's what the CRM provides us with. And then at the end
						of it, the data that we've produced in this rich environment we can
						then use to tell our stories – to tell our history of objects, to
						look at the way people have used these objects over time, the
						evolution of these objects <em>and</em> we can look at the evolution
						of our understanding of these objects. So not only can we produce
						cultural history, we can produce cultural history of cultural
						historians. We can look at the archaeology of archaeologists, if you
						like, and understand how they’ve understood the past and how their
						understanding of the past has changed over time. So we can write
						histories of our profession as well as histories of the people in
						the past. And there we’re going to present stuff in order and give
						people the guide through our argument and our discussion: show them
						the evidence, and provides our audience with an understanding of how
						we reached our conclusions, as well as what the conclusions are.
						This is that of the end result, which is going to be based on the
						work we did in the rich CRM environment.

						One of the ways that we can use the CRM is an application is to do
						this kind of repository indexing, where we’re going to go into the
						individual documents - whether this is a database or a text
						document. We’re going to extract information out that refers to
						things in the CRM - actors, events and objects - and identify the
						fact that this is in this document, and this is in this document and
						it also appears in this document. So now I’ve got a link between
						this document and this document. And that process allows me to bring
						together these different silos of information and blend them into an
						overarching web of information, which I can run queries across.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="chapter" id="slide-59"><h2>Slide 59</h2>
					<p>
						And this is the kind of thing that we can do: we can take digital
						library information from different institutions, and find out where
						this sample – who sponsored the expedition &lt;during&gt; which that
						sample was that gathered. So we’re going to leap across document
						boundaries, because the document boundary that talks about the
						setting up of the expedition doesn't mention the actual sample which
						was gathered in that expedition. In this case we’re talking about
						the discovery of Lucy, one of the very ancient type fossils. The
						records for Lucy don't include who set up the original expedition,
						but by jumping across documents we can say: “Ah! This institution
						helped in the discovery of Lucy, and that kind of thing can be very
						useful if you’re trying to look at the social history of an
						institution – what did they do? So that’s the kind of thing that we
						can do.

						Tony Gill was one of the development team on the CRM, &lt;and&gt;
						used the CRM to do this massive merge of different databases for the
						materials project at the research library group. From his work, he
						identified these five key points to using the CRM. First is that
						it’s elegant and simple compared with a comparable ER diagram, a
						comparable relational model, because the relational models tend to
						be very detailed and have to have different fields for every
						possible combination. It makes it much easier to analyze different…
						he had to analyze 1460 different data sources, in order to produce a
						single model which would enable all of these institutions to export
						their data and provide it as a single queriable platform. He found
						it elegant and simple; it allowed him to integrate information at
						varying degrees of detail. &lt;For&gt; some of the institutions this
						was just as a sideline database to their primary databases, so it
						wasn't detailed. At others, this was primarily what they were
						concerned with, so they had very detailed databases. He was able to
						use the CRM to bring them into line and allow them to integrate
						across all these different levels of granularity. It’s readily
						extensible by using the class typing and specialisations, so just by
						using good E55 Type thesauri, he was able to do a lot of the
						integration work without having to go into extensions, but the
						extensions were there for him to use if he needed to. In fact he
						didn't need to use them in that project, he was able to do it all by
						just managing it through types. The rich semantic content - actually
						picking out those embedded events and embedded identities, as
						opposed to names - he was able to draw inferences which he would
						never have been able to draw from the underspecified data elements
						in some of the databases. If he’d used Dublin Core, he would not
						have been able to do the things that he could do by using the CRM to
						merge these 1400 different data sources. It's been designed to do
						<em>exactly</em> what he wanted to do, so it was an absolutely
						perfect fit: it had all the functionality he wanted, but if he had
						used a different ontology, which didn't have that functionality in
						its design concept, he wouldn't have been able to achieve what he
						was able to achieve in a very short period of time. It was 1460
						databases, and I think it took less than eight months from project
						start to completion, with the whole thing deployed. That’s an
						amazing achievement.

						What’s the state of development? Well, it’s ISO 21127, published in
						October 2006. The extension to cover the functional requirement for
						bibliographic records, and the functional requirement for something
						data… look-up data, master lists of people and titles, and the CRM
						has resulted in FRBR <sub>00</sub>, the functional requirement for
						bibliographic references object-oriented model, and that has now
						been approved by the International Federation of Library
						Associations, the owners of FRBR and FRAD, and CIDOC, so it’s now am
						out there as a public document available for use. What this deals
						with is thinking about works, about the intellectual
						conceptualisations. It takes a conceptual object and actually
						considers the entire history of it, from the moment you first
						thought of it through to its publication in a publication series, or
						as an individual book, and how to manage all of that, including
						handwritten copies and copies written… published by printing press
						or electronically published. So it covers the whole of the creation
						of abstract thinking, of immaterial ideas. We’re working with the
						TEI - the Text Encoding Initiative - in order to build up a model of
						how to look at the content of a text that’s been marked up with TEI,
						where the TEI shows us the structure of the document. So TEI gives
						the <em>structure</em> of documents, and CRM gives us content. We’re
						merging those two to produce a very rich markup environment for
						text, originally designed for mediaeval texts. We’ve got application
						models, like the CRM Core, and good and rich data formats, exchange
						formats and extensions, so there is ongoing work with different
						sub-communities who are looking at ways of pushing the CRM model out
						further, and making it more useful. For instance, there’s an OWL
						version, which is currently being finalised so that it will be
						available in the WCCC OWL language for use as an ontology out in
						that environment.

				<div class="chapter" id="slide-62"><h2>Slide 62</h2>
					<p>
						So finally, what conclusions can we draw from this process?
						Strangely, everybody thinks that ontologies are very domain specific
						- that when you go for an ontology, what you're actually doing is
						really hemming yourself into working in a particular small
						environment. And what we’ve found with the CRM is almost the
						opposite - nearly all of it is
						<em>not</em> domain specific. I pointed out that very uniquely
						museum thing - the Current Permanent Location - but nearly all the
						rest of it is usable across a wide range of domains. And in fact
						we’ve been successfully deploying the CRM into medicine to look at
						the derivation and processing of cancer samples; &lt;into&gt;
						biodiversity, processing information about collecting samples and
						documenting biodiversity sampling. A whole range of different things
						use the same basic concepts that we use. So it’s a notion of
						scientific method - retrospective analysis, taxonomic discourse,
						which is common to archaeology and natural history - which show us
						that this model is useful <em>across</em> domains, it's not very
						specific to museums. We’ve been able to do it with a very small set
						of concepts. Everybody else has <em>huge</em> numbers of concepts,
						but we've got just over 200: 137 properties and 86 classes, and we
						been able to derive this massive range of things using this very
						small set of concepts. As we’ve added these dozens - indeed hundreds
						- of different formats to our understanding (we started from one
						standard, one CIDOC standard and we've grown out and we now have a
						couple of thousand standards that we’ve mapped), we’ve found that we
						add <em>very little</em> new stuff to the standard in order to
						explain these new richer formats for particular sub-domains. Some of
						them, getting very far out from the core of cultural heritage - the
						biodiversity stuff - we had to do virtually nothing to add all of
						the richness of biodiversity to it, just a very small extension.
						We’ve made the investment, it pays off and we think the CRM should
						be our language for semantic interoperability, certainly within the
						cultural heritage domain, but we’re finding that we can spread it
						out into natural history and indeed into some of medicine as well.
						So we’re really finding that the CRM gives us a <em>huge</em>
						capability to move data around between different groups, and that it
						gives us semantic richness to that. It's not just doing pattern
						matching in the text that we produce, we actually understand what
						that text means, and we can get at that meaning and relate it to
						other things. Thank you very much for your attention. I hope you've
						enjoyed this presentation, and we look forward to you using the CRM.
						Please tell us when you’ve used the CRM for your project, because we
						would like to keep not a handle or a control on it, we’d like to see
						all the different ways it’s being used, so that we can explore how
						to use it in further circumstances. Thank you very much.
